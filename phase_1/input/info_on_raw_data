The data comes originally from RITA (http://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp) where it is described in detail. You can download the data there, or from the bzipped csv files listed below. These files have derivable variables removed, are packaged in yearly chunks and have been more heavily compressed than the originals.
Data range from 1987 to 2008

Supplemental data


Airports
airports.csv describes the locations of US airports, with the fields:
iata: the international airport abbreviation code
name of the airport
city and country in which airport is located.
lat and long: the latitude and longitude of the airport
This majority of this data comes from the FAA, but a few extra airports (mainly military bases and US protectorates) were collected from other web sources by Ryan Hafen and Hadley Wickham.


Carrier codes
Listing of carrier codes with full names: carriers.csv


Planes
You can find out information about individual planes by googling the tail number or by looking it up in the FAA database. plane-data.csv is a csv file produced from the (some of) the data on that page.


Weather
Meteorological data is available from (among many others) NOAA and weather underground. The call sign for airport weather stations can be constructed by adding K to the airport code, e.g. KORD, KLAX, KSEA.
