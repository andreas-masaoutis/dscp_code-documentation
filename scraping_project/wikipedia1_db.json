The pilot phase will start in June 2010 in the cities of Milan and Brescia and will continue for a year. The two Lombardy cities are vying to become the \u201creference cities\u201d for electric transport in Italy, starting first of all with the development of a structured, complete and avant-garde electrical recharging network. The recharging infrastructure, whose installation by A2A in the cities of Milan and Brescia will commence in May, will be developed to carry out two recharging methods: The electrical energy supplied by A2A for recharging electric vehicles will derive significantly from renewable sources, this being a useful factor in pursuing an objective of a complete zero emission cycle. The vehicles that will be involved in the \u201cE-MOVING\u201d pilot scheme are two of the four comprising the Renault-Nissan Zero Emission range that will come onto the market as from 2011. The Renault-Nissan Alliance and A2A will work together to offer customers a wide range of commercial solutions for the purchase or the hire of Renault and Nissan zero emission vehicles and for the supply of electrical energy at a flat rate or based on consumption ",

S.p.A. is an Italian racing car and road car maker founded by Italo-Austrian Carlo Abarth in 1949.[3] Its logo is a shield with a stylized scorpion on a yellow and red background.[4] Abarth & C. S.p.A. is a fully owned subsidiary of FCA Italy S.p.A. (formerly Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A.), the subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (formerly of Fiat S.p.A.) controlling its European automotive production activities. Carlo Abarth was sporting director of the Cisitalia factory racing team starting in 1947.[5] 1948 saw the financial downfall of Cisitalia, spurred by the investments needed to put the 202 coup\u00e9 into production.  The following year the manufacturer folded, and founder Piero Dusio flew to Argentina. Carlo Abarth, funded by Armando Scagliarini,[a] took over Cisitalia's assets and on 31 March 1949 Abarth & C. was founded in Bologna.[6][7] Carlo's astrological sign, Scorpio, was chosen as the company logo. From the Cisitalia liquidation Abarth obtained five 204 sports cars (two complete Spiders and three unfinished), a D46 single seater and various spares.[5] The 204s were immediately rechristened Abarth 204 A.[5] Abarth built and raced sports cars developed from the last Cisitalia cars. In addition to Guido Scagliarini, the \"Squadra Abarth\" racing team lined up celebrated drivers including Tazio Nuvolari, Franco Cortese and Piero Taruffi. Notably Tazio Nuvolari made his last appearance in racing at the wheel of an Abarth 204 A, winning its class in the Palermo\u2013Monte Pellegrino hillclimb on 10 April 1950.[8] Alongside racing, the company's main activity was producing and selling accessories and performance parts for Fiat, Lancia, Cisitalia and Simca cars, like inlet manifolds and silencers.[9] On 9 April 1951 the company's headquarters were moved to Turin;[7] Abarth began his well-known association with Fiat in 1952, when it built the Abarth 1500 Biposto on Fiat mechanicals.[10] In the 1960s, Abarth was successful in hillclimbing and sports car racing, mainly in classes from 850 cc to 2000 cc, competing with Porsche 904 and Ferrari Dino. Hans Herrmann was a factory driver from 1962 until 1965, winning the 500 km N\u00fcrburgring in 1963 with Teddy Pilette.[11] Abarth promised Johann Abt that he could race a factory car free if he won all the races he entered.[when?] Abt almost succeeded: of the 30 races he entered, Abt won 29 and finished second once.[when?][11] Abt later founded Abt Sportsline. Abarth produced high-performance exhaust pipes, diversifying into tuning kits for road vehicles, mainly for Fiat. A racing exhaust was produced for the 1950s Lambretta models \"D\" and \"LD\". Original Abarth LD exhausts are now valuable collectors' items. Reproductions are available which carry the Abarth name, how Fiat feels about this is not known. Lambretta even held several 125 cc motorcycle land speed records during the 1950s thanks partly to the exhaust that Abarth developed for them.[12][13] Abarth also helped build sports or racing cars with Porsche[14] and Simca. Carlo sold Abarth to Fiat on 31 July 1971.[11] The acquisition was only made public by Fiat with a press release on 15 October.[15] As Fiat was not interested in the Reparto Corse racing operations, these were taken over by Enzo Osella.[11] Osella obtained cars, spares, technicians and drivers (amongst them Arturo Merzario), and continued the racing activity founding the Osella racing team.[16] Thus ended for Abarth the days of sport prototype and hill climb racing. Under Fiat ownership, Abarth became the Fiat Group's racing department, managed by engine designer Aurelio Lampredi.[11] Abarth prepared Fiat's rally cars, including the Fiat 124 Abarth Rally and 131 Abarth.[11] In December 1977, in advance of the 1978 racing season, the beforehand competing Abarth and Squadra Corse Lancia factory racing operations were merged by Fiat into a single entity named EASA (Ente per l'Attivit\u00e0 Sportiva Automobilistica, Organization for Car Sports Racing Activities).[17] Cesare Fiorio (previously in charge of the Lancia rally team) was appointed director, while Daniele Audetto was sporting director; the EASA headquarters were set up in Abarth's Corso Marche (Turin) offices.[17] The combined racing department developed the Lancia Beta Montecarlo Turbo Group 5 racing car which won the 1980 World Championship for Makes and the 1981 World Endurance Championship of Makes. It also created the Lancia Rally 037 Group B rally car which won for Lancia the 1983 World Manufacturers' Championship). On 1 October 1981, Abarth & C. ceased to exist and was replaced by Fiat Auto Gestione Sportiva, a division of the parent company specialized in the management of racing programmes that would remain in operation through to the end of 1999, when it changed to Fiat Auto Corse S.p.A. Some commercial models built by Fiat or its subsidiaries Lancia and Autobianchi were co-branded Abarth, including the Autobianchi A112 Abarth, a popular \"boy racer\" because it was lightweight and inexpensive. In the 1980s, Abarth name was mainly used to mark performance cars, such as the Fiat Ritmo Abarth 125/130 TC. In 2000s, Fiat used the Abarth brand to designate a trim/model level, as in the Fiat Stilo Abarth. On 1 February 2007 Abarth was re-established as an independent unit with the launch of the current company, Abarth & C. S.p.a.,[18] controlled 100% by Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A., the subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. dealing with the production and selling of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The first model launched was the Abarth Grande Punto and the Abarth Grande Punto S2000. The brand is based in the Officine 83, part of the old Mirafiori engineering plant.[19] The CEO as of 2011 is Harald Wester.[20] In 2015, Abarth's parent company was renamed FCA Italy S.p.A., reflecting the incorporation of Fiat S.p.A. into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that took place in the previous months. Abarths collaboration with Yamaha to produce for 2017 a limited-edition \"Sport Heritage caf\u00e9 racer special\", the XSR900 Abarth based on Yamahas  XSR900  847\u00a0cc inline-triple neo-retro standard.[21] ",

            "text": "Aermacchi was an Italian aircraft manufacturer. Formerly known as Aeronautica Macchi, the company was founded in 1912 by Giulio Macchi at Varese in north-western Lombardy as Nieuport-Macchi, to build Nieuport monoplanes under licence for the Italian military. With a factory located on the shores of Lake Varese, the firm originally manufactured a series of Nieuport designs, as well as seaplanes. After  World War II, the company began producing motorcycles as a way to fill the post-war need for cheap, efficient transportation. The company later specialised in civil and military pilot training aircraft. In July 2003, Aermacchi was integrated into the Finmeccanica Group (now Leonardo)[1] as Alenia Aermacchi, which increased its shareholding to 99%. Since the beginning, the design and production of military trainers have been the core business of Alenia Aermacchi. The products include:  Alenia Aermacchi has cooperated in international military programs: Alenia Aermacchi takes part in the AMX program with Alenia Aeronautica and Embraer of Brazil with a total share of 24%. Alenia Aermacchi develops and manufactures the fuselage forward and rear sections and installs some avionic equipment in the aircraft. A Mid-Life Updating program is required by the Italian Air Force to upgrade the aircraft capabilities. Alenia Aermacchi designs and produces wing pylons and wing tips, roots, trailing edges and flaps, which represents a 5% share in the overall program. Alenia Aermacchi has a share of more than 4% in the Eurofighter program, for the design and development of wing pylons, twin missile and twin store carriers, ECM pods, carbon fiber structures and titanium engine cowlings. After participating in the G-222 transport aircraft program, the company is involved in the new Military Transport Aircraft C-27J Spartan, for the production of outer wings. Since the mid-1990s, Alenia Aermacchi has participated in programs for the supply of engine nacelles for civil aircraft. It produces cold parts for engine nacelles: inlets, fan cowls and EBU, the systems-to-engine interface.  In 1999, the company established a joint venture (MHD) with Hurel-Dubois (presently Hurel-Hispano, of SNECMA group), a French company specializing in the development and manufacture of thrust reversers, to obtain the full responsibility for the development of nacelles installed on maximum 100-seat aircraft. Aermacchi began producing motorcycles in c. 1951; the first Aermacchi to be marketed to the public was a scooter/motorcycle hybrid called the 'Convertible', with the majority of working parts semi-enclosed, an under-saddle engine and foot boards, a conventional motorcycle fuel tank position and 17\u00a0in (430\u00a0mm) wheels. It was succeeded in 1953 by the 'Zeffiro' which was offered with a 125\u00a0cc or 150\u00a0cc two-stroke engine; these later models had upgraded suspension but remained similar in appearance. In 1955 they produced the 125\u00a0cc Monsone, followed by the 150\u00a0cc Corsaro, both of which had pivoted fork rear suspension and telescopic front forks. They were two-strokes like the early models and ran a 4-speed gearbox. In 1956 they produced their first over head valve four-stroke engine on the Chimera fitted horizontally, a layout which would become a standard for the marque. Similar to their first offering, the Chimera kept many enclosed working parts. In 1957 they released a series of sport models, powered by a single cylinder ohv engine in 175\u00a0cc or 250\u00a0cc displacements. Aermacchi continued with scooter production, but sales were poor and they were unable to compete in the market amongst the well established Vespas and Lambrettas, and concentrated solely on the production of motorcycles.[2] In 1960, US business Harley-Davidson motorcycles purchased 50% of Aermacchi's motorcycle division. The Italian branch of the brand was named 'Aermacchi-Harley-Davidson' and the first bike was a variation of the 'Ala Verde' suitably modified for the American market. This was also the year that the Chimera ceased production. The remaining motorcycle holdings were sold in 1974 to AMF-Harley-Davidson, with motorcycles continuing to be made at Varese. The business was sold to Cagiva in 1978.[2] After the Harley Davidson takeover, Aermacchi branched out into racing with a 250\u00a0cc production-volume Ala d'Oro for road racing competition. Early results varied but over years of bike development the team placed third during the 1966 350\u00a0cc World Championship with racer Renzo Pasolini and third again in 1968 with Kelvin Carruthers. The following year Carruthers competed at the Isle of Man TT, despite moderate success Harley-Davidson lost interest in the Italian offshoot.[2] ",

It has been a subsidiary of the multinational petroleum company Eni since 2003, when Eni acquired Agip Petroli S.p.A., creating the Refining and Marketing Division (R&M). In 1924 Sinclair Oil, a U.S. oil company, and the Italian Ministry of National Economy created a fifty-year joint venture agreement to explore for oil in Emilia-Romagna and Sicily, over an area of 40,000\u00a0km\u00b2. 40% of the capital was held by the ministry, all expenditure was incurred by Sinclair Oil and 25% of profits went to the Italian ministry. The political opposition, headed by Giacomo Matteotti and Don Sturzo, alleged that the joint venture was damaging to the nation and started a controversy which led to suspicions of corruption; Matteotti indeed was killed two days before he was due to give a speech on this issue. Don Sturzo continued the controversy, stating that a public company was the only way to maintain national energy independence.  Coal in Italy was scarce and of poor quality. It was imported from abroad at prices that weighed on Italy\u2019s trade balance and limited industrial growth. Power plants, which were not very developed and mainly concentrated in the north of the country, could not satisfy the needs of energy. With a royal decree on April 3, 1926, the government of the Kingdom of Italy established the Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli (AGIP), a joint stock company, to conduct all activities relating to the petroleum industry. 60 percent of the share capital was held by the Ministry of the Treasury, 20% by Istituto Nazionale Assicurazioni (INA), and the remaining 20% by the Italian Social Insurance fund. The first president was Ettore Conti, a contractor in the electricity sector. The establishment of the company was attributed by many analysts to Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata, Ministry of Finance, and Giuseppe Belluzzo, Ministry for the National Economy. Volpi di Misurata, however, was directly involved in oil-related interests, working together with FIAT of Giovanni Agnelli, and with the financial backing of Banca Commerciale Italiana, which had searched unsuccessfully for oil in Emilia-Romagna. In 1927 a Mining Act was enacted, which gave the ownership of the subsoil to the State and imposed the rule that any oil-related activity was subject to government authorization and / or grant.  Agip experienced difficulties after the crisis of 1929 but began to flourish in the 1930s. In 1933 a new law was issued that restrained protectionist refineries and AGIP could operate with greater ease in this area. AGIP had a facility for refining at Fiume and in 1936 it took over a refinery at Porto Marghera, owned by Volpi di Misurata. Soon after it made an agreement with Montecatini to create a joint enterprise, Anic (Fuel Hydrogenation National Company), which was to pursue the derivation of fuel by hydrogenation of brown coal. Anic built two refineries to process the oil extracted in Albania from Azienda Italiana Petroli Albanesi (AIPA), a subsidiary of AGIP. However, the Albanian oil was of poor quality and its processing proved uneconomical.  Simultaneously, however, because of the costs to support colonial campaigns, Agip had to exit some foreign investments, in particular their exploration campaigns in Iraq. It was the explorer Ardito Desio who found oil in Libya and in 1939 came the so-called \"Petrolibia operation\", in which AGIP was linked to FIAT, with which the year before it had created an Italian company for synthetic fuels, to explore the possibility of obtaining gasoline from synthetic chemistry.

(previously Finmeccanica).[3] It was formed in July 2000 as an Anglo-Italian[4] multinational company, when Finmeccanica and GKN merged their respective helicopter subsidiaries (Agusta and Westland Helicopters) to form AgustaWestland,[5] with each holding a 50% share. Finmeccanica acquired GKN's stake in AgustaWestland in 2004. Since 2016 it has been merged in Leonardo where it became the company's helicopters division under the Leonardo Helicopters brand.[6][7] The collaboration between Agusta and Westland dates back to 1981, when the two companies established the European Helicopter Industries joint venture with the aim of developing a new medium-size utility helicopter, the EH101. In March 1999, Finmeccanica and GKN announced their intention to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries.[8] The two parties announced finalised terms for the merger in July 2000, which included a 50:50 ownership structure, and the payment of top-up fees to GKN to compensate for a disparity in profit levels between Agusta and Westland.[9][10] In January 2002, AgustaWestland announced that it would be cutting a total of 950 jobs in the United Kingdom and closing its factory in Weston-super-Mare, which carried out customer support work, as activity was concentrated at its main site in Yeovil.[11] On 26 May 2004, GKN confirmed that it had agreed to sell its share of AgustaWestland to Finmeccanica for \u00a31.06\u00a0billion.[12][13] The sale was approved by the British government in October 2004.[14] AgustaWestland opened offices in Philadelphia in 2005, and won a contract to build the new presidential helicopter Marine One over the U.S. manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft, but this program was canceled in 2009.[15] In November 2005 it was announced that AgustaWestland had agreed to acquire Bell Helicopter's 25 per cent interest in the AB139 medium twin helicopter program, and to increase its interest in the BA609 civil tiltrotor aircraft from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.[16] In June 2008, AgustaWestland and the Russia-based helicopter manufacturer Russian Helicopters agreed to form a new joint venture company to assemble AW139 helicopters in Russia.[17] Construction of a $50\u00a0million helicopter assembly facility in the town of Tomilino near Moscow began in June 2010.[18][19] In early 2010, AgustaWestland acquired PZL-\u015awidnik, a Polish helicopter manufacturer.[20] In September 2012, AgustaWestland and Northrop Grumman announced the signing of a comprehensive teaming agreement under which the companies will jointly bid for contracts to build the U.S. Air Force Combat Rescue helicopter and U.S. Navy's new \"Marine One\" presidential helicopter.[21] In March 2013, AgustaWestland announced its Project Zero hybrid tiltrotor/fan-in-wing technology demonstrator. The unmanned demonstrator made its first tethered flight in June 2011 at AgustaWestland's Cascina Costa, Italy facility. According to the company, the aircraft \"employs no hydraulics, doesn't burn fossil fuel and generates zero emissions.\"[22] India signed a contract to purchase 12 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters in February 2010 for the Communication Squadron of Indian Air Force to carry the president, PM and other VVIPs.  Controversy over the contract came to light on 12 February 2013 with the arrest of Giuseppe Orsi, the CEO of Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland's parent company by Italian authorities;[23] the following day Indian Defence Minister A.K. Antony ordered a probe into the contract.[24] In January 2014, India cancelled the US$630\u00a0million deal with AgustaWestland for purchasing 12 AW101s meant for use by VIPs. Following this event, in June 2014 India recovered the entire sum of Rs 18.18\u00a0billion which it had paid to the company.[25] The decision to annul the 2010 deal, being probed by the CBI for irregularities, came after a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Defence Minister A.K. Antony in New Delhi. According to the Defence Ministry, the government cancelled the contract \"on grounds of breach of the Pre-contract Integrity pact and the agreement by AWIL (AgustaWestland International Ltd)\". The contract was frozen in February 2013 after allegations surfaced that US$60\u00a0million had been paid as a bribe.[26] In 2016, following a corporate reorganization, AgustaWestland was merged in Leonardo, Finmecannica new name. Since that moment, AgustaWestland will cease to exist as a company, becoming Leonardo's helicopter division. Comparable major helicopter manufacturers: ",

            "text": "Air One S.p.A. was an Italian low-cost airline which operated as Air One \"Smart Carrier\". It operated as Alitalia's low cost carrier subsidiary with operating bases located in Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, Palermo Falcone\u2013Borsellino Airport, Pisa Airport, Venice Marco Polo Airport and Verona Villafranca Airport; while Tirana was a focus city.[2] \"Air One\" is a portmanteau of the English meaning Air One and the Italian word 'airone', meaning heron (the bird depicted in the airline's logo), which was also the airline's callsign. Before the merger with Alitalia, Air One was a competitor, the second largest airline in Italy, with a network to 36 destinations in Italy, Europe and North America. Its main bases were Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Linate Airport in Milan and Turin Airport.[3] Air One ceased operations on 30 October 2014[1] as part of the new concept of its parent company Alitalia based on its new partnership with Etihad Airways. All routes were either cancelled or taken over by Alitalia itself. Air One began life as Aliadriatica which was established in Pescara in 1983 to operate as a flying school and provide air-taxi services and later regional scheduled services. In 1988 Gruppo Toto, one of the leading building and civil engineering groups in Italy, became the majority shareholder. With the acquisition of its first Boeing 737-200 in June 1994, Aliadriatica started scheduled and charter operations. On 27 April 1995 Aliadriatica began scheduled flights between Milan (Linate) and Brindisi and Reggio Calabria and Lamezia Terme. On 23 November 1995, the new name Air One was adopted and the airline began operating scheduled flights between Rome and Milan. In 1996, the first full year of operations, 713,000 passengers were carried and the airline expanded rapidly thereafter. In the year 2000 Air One announced a partnership with Lufthansa and nearly all Air One flights became code-shared with Lufthansa. As from June 2006, regional destinations were served under the name Air One CityLiner with the brand new fleet of Bombardier CRJ-900s.[3] In 2007, Air One carried approximately 5.5 million passengers (scheduled and charter), thus becoming the second largest Italian airline in terms of passenger traffic. 2007 revenues totaled EUR750 million with a net profit of EUR6.8 million. In August 2008, it was announced that Air One was to be merged with Alitalia.[4] Air One was almost bankrupt in 2008,[5] and the merger with Alitalia-CAI was the only viable solution to save it. On 13 January 2009, Air One officially became part of Alitalia, though the two airlines were to be combined into one over time.  A detailed integration plan was at that time yet to be announced. On 28 March 2009, due to the merger with Alitalia, the cooperation between Lufthansa's Miles & More and Air One ended.[6] On 28 June 2009, also due to the Alitalia merger, the partnerships with United Airlines' Mileage Plus program and Air Canada's Aeroplan program ended.[7] Later in 2009, the Alitalia and Air One booking procedures were unified so that the airlines effectively became the same. On 28 March 2010, Air One Smart Carrier as a separate brand from Alitalia began operating low-cost flights out of Milan Malpensa Airport. Nine domestic and five international destinations were initially served, using five Airbus A320's painted in the Air One livery and formatted to 180 seats.[8] In its first full quarter of operations, Air One Smart Carrier transported 320 000 passengers, with an on-time performance of 89%.[9] On 2 February 2011, Air One Smart Carrier announced that, in the Summer 2011 season, it would expand its operations at Milan Malpensa and also open a new base at Pisa Airport. The base opened on 1 July 2011.[10] Air One Smart Carrier predicted it would carry 1,6 million passengers in 2011, compared to 0,9 million in 2010, and a new website was also launched. On 21 December 2011, Air One Smart Carrier announced a new base at Venice Marco Polo Airport, with flights starting in May 2012. On 1 October 2012, operations commenced at Air One Smart Carrier's new base in Catania Fontanarossa Airport, the fourth base.  In September 2013 the opening of a fifth base at Palermo Falcone-Borsellino Airport was announced with flights to commence in March 2014 including a new route to London Gatwick Airport, a destination not served by Air One since the ending of flights from Milan Malpensa Airport. On 26 October 2013, Air One closed its operating base in Milan Malpensa Airport and announced a new base at Palermo Falcone\u2013Borsellino Airport. The flights from Palermo started in March 2014. On 26 August 2014, it was announced that parent-company Alitalia would shut down Air One by autumn 2014.[1] All remaining routes were terminated by 30 October 2014 with some base operations and routes already closed by 30 September.[1][11] Some routes, especially within Italy, have been taken over by Alitalia itself as well as the former Air One fleet. Air One operated the following aircraft types during its history:[12] The Air One fleet progression over the years:  Media related to Air One at Wikimedia Commons ",

            "text": "Alessi is a housewares and kitchen utensil company in Italy, manufacturing and marketing everyday items authored by a wide range of designers, architects, and industrial designers \u2014 including Achille Castiglioni, Richard Sapper, Alessandro Mendini, Ettore Sottsass, Wiel Arets, Zaha Hadid, Toyo Ito, Tom Kovac, Greg Lynn, MVRDV, Jean Nouvel, UN Studio, Michael Graves and Philippe Starck.  Alessi was founded in 1921 by Giovanni Alessi. The firm began as a workshop in ostrich near Lake Orta in the Italian Alps near Switzerland. An area known for its tradition in making small objects of wood or metal for the house and kitchen. Alessi started with producing a wide range of tableware items in nickel, chromium and silver-plated brass. The company's intention was to produce hand-crafted items with the aid of machines. Design in the current sense of the term began when Carlo Alessi (born 1916), who is the son of Giovanni, was named chief designer. Carlo was trained as an industrial designer. Between 1935 and 1945 he developed virtually all of the products Alessi produced. In 1945 he ascended to chief executive and designed the coffee service. In 1956 the company was under the leadership of Alessi Carlo.[1] It was his brother Ettore Alessi who introduced the collaboration with external designers in 1955. With some architects, he designed a number of items which were created for the hotel needs. Through his intervention caused many individual objects, which were best-sellers, such as the historical series of wire baskets. One of the key designs of this period is the shaker from 1957 by Luigi Massoni and Carlo Mazzeri. This was designed in a series with an Ice bucket and Ice tongs as part of the Program 4 for the 11 Triennale in Milan.[2] This was the first time that the Alessi products got shown with manufactured goods. The 1950s were a difficult time to sell designer objects, as it was only a few years after World War II, and many people could not afford them. In 1970, Alberto Alessi was responsible for the third transformation of the company. Alessi was considered one of the \"Italian Design Factories\". In this decade under the leadership of Alberto Alessi the company collaborated with some design maestros like Achille Castiglioni, Richard Sapper, Alessandro Mendini, and Ettore Sottsass. In the '70's, Alessi produced the Condiment set (salt, pepper and toothpicks) by Ettore Sottsass, the Espressomaker by Sapper. The 1980s marked a period in which Italian design factories had to compete with mass production. These movements had a different view on design, for the Italian design factories the design and therefore the designer was the most important part of the process while for the mass production the design had to be functional and easy to be reproduced.[3] Also in the 1980s, they changed their marketing image from factory to industrial research lab, a place for research and production. For Alessi the '80's are marked with some designs like the Two tone kettle by Sapper, their first cutlery set Dry by Castiglioni. Alessi collaborated with new designers like Aldo Rossi, Michael Graves, and Philippe Starck, who have been responsible for the some of Alessi's all time bestseller like the kettle with a bird whistle by Graves. The company make unusual market greatly expanded, Alessi faced increasing competition from other international manufacturers, especially in lower-cost products mass-produced for retailers such as Target Corporation and J. C. Penney. In the 1990s Alessi started to work more with plastics, at the request of designers who found it an easier material to work with than metal, offering more design freedom and innovative possibilities. The 1990s were marked by the theme \"Family Follows Fiction\", with playful and imaginative objects. Artists designing for this theme included Stefano Giovannoni, and Alessandro Mendini, who designed Fruit Mama and the bestseller Anna G. Metal still remained a popular material, for example the Girotondo family by King Kong. During the 2000s, Alessi collaborated with several architects for its \"coffee and tea towers,\" with a new generation of architects such as Wiel Arets, Zaha Hadid, Toyo Ito, Tom Kovac, Greg Lynn, MVRDV, Jean Nouvel, and UN Studio. These sets had a limited production of 99 copies. Another remarkable design in the 2000s is the Blow Up series by Fratelli Campana. The brothers played with form and shape to create baskets and other objects that look like they would fall apart when touched. 2006 to the present In 2006 the company reclassified its products under three lines: \"A di Alessi,\" \"Alessi,\"  and \"Officina Alessi.\"  A di Alessi is more \"democratic\" and more \"pop,\" the lower price range of Alessi. The Officina Alessi is more exclusive, innovative and experimental, marked by small batch production series and limited series. Alessi products are on display in museums worldwide like Museum of Modern Art (New York), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Victoria and Albert Museum, Pompidou Centre, and Stedelijk Museum Italy. From 1945 until today Alessi has collaborated with designers and even other brands or companies for their products. Some key designs and their designers: A collaboration with the National Palace Museum of Taiwan, produced a collection of various kitchenware products with Asian themes.[citation needed] Oval breadbasket, 1955 Sapper kettle, 1983 Graves tea service, 1983 Graves kettle, 1984 Starck Juicy Salif juicer Firebird gas lighter by Guido Venturini Alessi fruit basket ",

            "text": " Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. (Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8alfa ro\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0o]) is an Italian luxury car manufacturer, founded by Frenchman Alexandre Darracq as Societ\u00e0 Anonima Italiana Darracq (SAID), a company that would produce and sell special Darracq models for Italy. In late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly, and the Italian partners of the company hired Giuseppe Merosi to design new cars. On 24 June 1910, a new company was founded named  A.L.F.A. (\"[Societ\u00e0] Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili\", \"Anonymous Lombard Automobile Factory\") on 24 June 1910, in Milan (initially still in partnership with Darracq).[2] The brand is known for sporty vehicles and has been involved in car racing since 1911. The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Merosi. A.L.F.A. ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models. In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo 20\u201330 HP the first car to be so badged. In 1921, the Banca Italiana di Sconto, which backed the Ing. Nicola Romeo & Co, went broke and the government needed to support the industrial companies involved, among which was Alfa Romeo, through the \"Consorzio per Sovvenzioni sui Valori Industriali\". In 1925, the railway activities were separated from the Romeo company, and in 1928, Nicola Romeo left. In 1933, the state ownership was reorganized under the banner of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) by Benito Mussolini's government, which then had effective control. The company struggled to return to profitability after the Second World War, and turned to mass-producing small vehicles rather than hand-building luxury models. In 1954, it developed the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, which would remain in production until 1994. During the 1960s and 1970s, Alfa Romeo produced a number of sporty cars, but struggled to make a profit, so Istituto per la Reconstruzione (IRI), the state conglomerate that controls Finmeccanica sold the marque to the Fiat Group in 1986.[3] Alfa Romeo has competed successfully in Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar racing, touring car racing, and rallies. It has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries (usually under the name Alfa Corse or Autodelta), and private entries. The first racing car was made in 1913, three years after the foundation of the company, and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. The race victories gave a sporty image to the marque, and Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before becoming independent in 1939. It has had the most wins of any marque in the world.[4] The company's name is a combination of the original name, \"A.L.F.A.\" (\"Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili\"), and the last name of entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who took control of the company in 1915. The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded as Societ\u00e0 Anonima Italiana Darracq (SAID) in 1906 by the French automobile firm of Alexandre Darracq, with some Italian investors. One of them, Cavaliere Ugo Stella, an aristocrat from Milan, became chairman of the SAID in 1909.[5] The firm's initial location was in Naples, but even before the construction of the planned factory had started, Darracq decided late in 1906 that Milan would be more suitable and accordingly a tract of land was acquired in the Milan suburb of Portello, where a new factory of 6,700 square metres (8,000\u00a0sq\u00a0yd) was erected. Late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and Stella, with the other Italian co-investors, founded a new company named A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili), initially still in partnership with Darracq. The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Giuseppe Merosi, hired in 1909 for designing new cars more suited to the Italian market.  Merosi would go on to design a series of new A.L.F.A. cars, with more powerful engines (40\u201360 HP). A.L.F.A. ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24-hp models. In 1914, an advanced Grand Prix car was designed and built, the GP1914, with a four-cylinder engine, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, and twin ignition.[6] However, the onset of the First World War halted automobile production at A.L.F.A. for three years. In August 1915, the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. Munitions, aircraft engines and other components, compressors, and generators based on the company's existing car engines were produced in a vastly enlarged factory during the war. After the war, Romeo invested his war profits in acquiring locomotive and railway carriage plants in Saronno (Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno), Rome (Officine Meccaniche di Roma), and Naples (Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali), which were added to his A.L.F.A. ownership. Car production had not been considered at first, but resumed in 1919 since parts for the completion of 105 cars had remained at the A.L.F.A. factory since 1915.[5] In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo 20\u201330 HP the first car to be so badged.[8] Their first success came in 1920 when Giuseppe Campari won at Mugello and continued with second place in the Targa Florio driven by Enzo Ferrari. Giuseppe Merosi continued as head designer, and the company continued to produce solid road cars as well as successful race cars (including the 40\u201360 HP and the RL Targa Florio). In 1923 Vittorio Jano was lured from Fiat, partly thanks to the persuasion of a young Alfa racing driver named Enzo Ferrari, to replace Merosi as chief designer at Alfa Romeo. The first Alfa Romeo under Jano was the P2 Grand Prix car, which won Alfa Romeo the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. For road cars Jano developed a series of small-to-medium-displacement 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder inline engines based on the P2 unit that established the architecture of the company's engines, with light alloy construction, hemispherical combustion chambers, centrally located plugs, two rows of overhead valves per cylinder bank and dual overhead cams. Jano's designs proved both reliable and powerful. Enzo Ferrari proved a better team manager than driver, and when the factory team was privatised, it became Scuderia Ferrari. When Ferrari left Alfa Romeo, he went on to build his own cars. Tazio Nuvolari often drove for Alfa, winning many races before the Second World War. In 1928 Nicola Romeo left, and in 1933 Alfa Romeo was rescued by the government, which then had effective control. Alfa Romeo became an instrument of Mussolini's Italy, a national emblem. During this period it built bespoke vehicles for the wealthy, with bodies normally by Touring of Milan or Pinin Farina. This era peaked with the Alfa Romeo 2900B Type 35 racers. The Alfa factory (converted during wartime to the production of Macchi C.202 Folgore engines: the Daimler-Benz 600 series built under license) was bombed during the Second World War, and struggled to return to profitability after the war. The luxury vehicles were out. Smaller, mass-produced vehicles began to be produced beginning with the 1954 model year, with the introduction of the Giulietta series of berline (saloons/sedans), coupes and open two-seaters.  All three varieties shared what would become the Alfa Romeo overhead Twin Cam four-cylinder engine, initially 1300 cc. This engine would eventually be enlarged to 2000 cc and would remain in production until 1995. When I see an Alfa Romeo go by, I tip my hat.Once motor sports resumed after the Second World War, Alfa Romeo proved to be the car to beat in Grand Prix events.  The introduction of the new formula (Formula One) for single-seat racing cars provided an ideal setting for Alfa Romeo's Tipo 158 Alfetta, adapted from a pre-war voiturette, and Giuseppe Farina won the first Formula One World Championship in 1950 in the 158. Juan Manuel Fangio secured Alfa's second consecutive championship in 1951. In 1952, Alfa Romeo experimented with its first front-wheel drive compact car, \"Project 13\u201361\".[14] It had the same transverse-mounted, forward-motor layout as the modern front-wheel drive automobile. Alfa Romeo made a second attempt toward the late 1950s based on Project 13\u201361. It was to be called Tipo 103 and resembled the smaller version of its popular Alfa Romeo Giulia. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the Tipo 103 never saw production. Had Alfa Romeo produced it, it would have preceded the Mini as the first \"modern\" front-wheel drive compact car. In the mid-fifties, Alfa Romeo entered into an agreement with Brazil's Matarazzo Group to create a company called Fabral (F\u00e1brica Brasileira de Autom\u00f3veis Alfa, \"the Brazilian Alfa automobile factory\") to build the Alfa Romeo 2000 there. After having received government approval, Matarazzo pulled out and under pressure from Brazil's President Juscelino Kubitschek the state-owned FNM company instead commenced building the car as the \"FNM 2000\" there in 1960.[15] During the 1960s, Alfa Romeo concentrated on competition using production-based cars, including the GTA (standing for Gran Turismo Allegerita), an aluminium-bodied version of the Bertone-designed coupe with a powerful twin-plug engine.  Among other victories, the GTA won the inaugural Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am championship in 1966.  In the 1970s, Alfa Romeo concentrated on prototype sports car racing with the Tipo 33, with early victories in 1971. Eventually the Tipo 33TT12 gained the World Championship for Makes for Alfa Romeo in 1975 and the Tipo 33SC12 won the World Championship for Sports Cars in 1977.[16][17] By the 1970s, Alfa Romeo was again in financial trouble and creative measures were attempted to shore it up, including an ultimately unsuccessful joint venture with Nissan endorsed by Ettore Massacesi of Alfa Romeo's parent company, the Italian-government owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) and Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga. By 1986, IRI was suffering heavy losses, and IRI president Romano Prodi put Alfa Romeo up for sale. Finmeccanica, the mechanical holdings arm of IRI and its predecessors owned Alfa Romeo since 1932. Prodi first approached fellow Italian manufacturer Fiat, which offered to start a joint venture with Alfa. Fiat withdrew its plan for a joint venture when Ford put in an offer to acquire part of Alfa Romeo and restructure the company, while increasing its stake over time. However, Fiat put in a bid to acquire the entirety of Alfa Romeo and offer job guarantees to Italian workers, an offer that Ford was unwilling to match. It also did not hurt any of the parties involved that an acquisition by Fiat would keep Alfa Romeo in Italian hands. In 1986, the deal was concluded with Alfa Romeo merged with traditional rival Lancia into Fiat's Alfa Lancia Industriale S.p.A. Models produced from the 1990s combined Alfa's traditional virtues of avant-garde styling and sporting panache with the economic benefits of product rationalisation, and include a \"GTA\" version of the 147 hatchback, the Giugiaro-designed Brera, and a high-performance exotic called the 8C Competizione (named after one of Alfa's most successful prewar sports and racing cars, the 8C of the 1930s). In 2005 Maserati was bought back from Ferrari and under Fiat's full control. The Fiat Group plans to create a sports and luxury division from Maserati and Alfa Romeo.[18] There is a planned strategic relationship between these two; engines, platforms and possibly dealers will be shared in some markets.[19] In the beginning of 2007, Fiat Auto S.p.A. was reorganized and four new automobile companies were created; Fiat Automobiles S.p.A., Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A., Lancia Automobiles S.p.A. and Fiat Light Commercial Vehicles S.p.A. These companies are fully owned by Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A (from 2007 FCA Italy S.p.A.).[20] On 24 June 2010, Alfa Romeo celebrated 100 years from its foundation.[21] Alfa Romeo has been suffering from falling sales. Some[who?] analysts concluded that the automaker suffered large operating losses in the mid-2000s \u2013 estimated to be about 15 percent to 20 percent of annual revenues, or about 300 million to 500 million euros a year.[citation needed] In 2010, it sold a total of about 112,000 units, which was significantly lower than Fiat CEO Marchionne's global sales target of 300,000. Alfa then wanted to achieve 170,000 sales in 2011, including 100,000 Giulietta and 60,000 MiTo, but it actually sold 130,000 units that year.[22] Its medium-term target was 500,000 units by 2014 including 85,000 from the North American market.[23] In 2017 Alfa Romeo increased production by 62 percent, building a total of 150,722 vehicles at the company's three factories.[24] Alfa Romeo was imported to the United States by Max Hoffman from the mid-1950s.[25] The Giulietta Spider was born by request of Max Hoffman, who proposed an open version of the Giulietta.[26] In 1961 Alfa Romeo started exporting cars to the United States.[27] In 1995, Alfa Romeo ceased exporting cars to the United States,[28] the last model sold in that market being the 164 sedans. Since that time, rumours of a return culminated with a website announcement stating \"The long-awaited return of Alfa Romeo to the United States market should take place by 2007, with a range of new models.\" In fact, Alfa Romeo's return to United States was officially confirmed on 5 May 2006 by Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne. North American sales resumed in October 2008, with the launch of the low production 8C Competizione coupe.[29] Also in 2008, Alfa Romeo and Chrysler were reported to be in discussions over the possibility of producing Alfa Romeo cars in some Chrysler manufacturing plants that had shutdown due to the company group's restructure and cost cutting. Instead, as reported by The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2009, Chrysler discontinued several Dodge and Jeep models while phasing in Alfa Romeo ones and the new Fiat 500.[30] The next significant milestones in Alfa Romeo's North American return occurred in 2014, with the launch of the more affordable two-seater 4C coupe. That year, Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. confirmed that its original agreement with Mazda Motor Corporation, for the speculated manufacturing of a new Alfa Romeo Spider based on the Mazda Miata, had been terminated mutually in December 2014 (with this joint-venture's Miata-based car, becoming the new 2015 Fiat 124 convertible). In 2015, Alfa Romeo's return to this market was further bolstered by the automaker's display of the new Giulia at the Los Angeles Auto Show. In February 2017, Chrysler featured its Alfa Romeo brand exclusively in three ads during Super Bowl LI.[31] Alfa Romeo's US importer, FCA US LLC, imports the 4C, Giulia and Stelvio. Alfa Romeo has introduced many technological innovations over the years, and the company has often been among the first users of new technologies. Its trademark double overhead cam engine was used for the first time in the 1914 Grand Prix car,[32] the first road car with such an engine, the 6C 1500 Sport, appeared in 1928. Alfa Romeo tested one of the very first electric injection systems (Caproni-Fuscaldo) in the Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 with \"Ala spessa\" body in 1940 Mille Miglia. The engine had six electrically operated injectors, fed by a semi-high pressure circulating fuel pump system.[33] 1969 models for the North American market had SPICA (Societ\u00e0 Pompe Iniezione Cassani & Affini, a subsidiary of Alfa Romeo) mechanical fuel injection. According to Alfa Romeo engine output and performance were unchanged from the carburetted version. The SPICA system continued until the 1982 model year with the introduction of 2.0 liter Bosch electronic fuel injection. Many examples of SPICA powered Alfa's are found still running, Mechanical variable valve timing was introduced in the Alfa Romeo Spider, sold in the U.S. in 1980.[34] All Alfa Romeo Spider models from 1983 onward used electronic VVT.[35] The 105 series Giulia was quite an advanced car, using such technologies as all-wheel disc brakes,[36] and a plastic radiator header tank[citation needed]. It had also the lowest drag coefficient (Cd) in its class[37] The same trend continued with the Alfetta 2000 and GTV, which had such things as 50:50 weight distribution,[38][39] standard fit alloy wheels[citation needed] and transaxle.[40] Newer innovations include complete CAD design process used in Alfa Romeo 164,[41] robotised/paddle control transmission Selespeed used in the 156;[42] the 156 was also the world's first passenger car to use Common rail diesel engine.[43] The Multiair -an electro-hydraulic variable valve actuation technology used in MiTo was introduced in 2009.[44] In 2016 Alfa Romeo Giulia came with electrical brakes.[45] Many famous automotive design houses in Italy have accepted commissions to produce concepts and production vehicle shapes for Alfa Romeo. These include: The last mentioned, the Centro Stile, has rapidly gained international credibility[vague] with its work. The 8C Competizione super-coup\u00e9, and the MiTo hatchback are the results. Construction techniques used by Alfa Romeo have become imitated by other car makers, and in this way Alfa Romeo body design has often been very influential. The following is a list of innovations, and where appropriate, examples of imitation by other car manufacturers: Alfa Romeo has made a number of concept cars: The Berlina Aerodinamica Tecnica prototype cars were designed by Bertone as an exercise in determining whether streamlining and wind-tunnel driven designs would result in high performance on a standard chassis, and whether the resulting vehicles would be palatable to public. Alfa 1900 Sprint were the basis of the B.A.T. 5, 7 and 9.[46] The later B.A.T. 11 was based on the 8C Competizione. The Tipo 33 racing car, with its high-revving 2000 cc V8 engine became the basis for a number of different concept cars during the 1960s and 1970s, two of which ultimately resulted in production vehicles. Most made their appearances at the Auto Salon Gen\u00e8ve. Here is a brief list: In general, concept cars for Alfa Romeo have generally become production vehicles, after some modification to make them suitable for manufacture, and to provide driver and passenger safety. The Zagato SZ, GTV and Spider, Brera and 159 are all good examples of Alfa Romeo's stylistic commitment in this direction. Alfa Romeo's logo incorporates two heraldic devices traditionally associated with its birthplace, the city of Milan: a red cross, from the emblem of Milan, and the biscione, a crowned viper swallowing a Moor\u2014emblem of the House of Visconti, rulers of the city in the 14th century.[47][48][49] The logo was originally designed in 1910 by a young Italian draughtsman from the A.L.F.A technical office, Romano Cattaneo.[50] In June 1910 the Societ\u00e0 Anonima Darracq became Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili, and was readying its first model, the 24 HP. The board asked chief engineer Giuseppe Merosi to devise a badge for the radiator shell of the new car; Merosi turned to his collaborators.[50] One of them, Cattaneo, was inspired by the coat of arms he had seen on the gates of Castello Sforzesco to include the biscione in the logo.[50] Merosi liked the idea, and together with Cattaneo came up with a sketch, then approved by managing director Ugo Stella; Cattaneo was entrusted with doing the final design.[50] The original badge was round, of enamelled brass, measuring 65\u00a0mm (2.6\u00a0in) in diameter, and carried already all the present day accoutrements: the red cross on a white field of Milan on the left, a green biscione on a light blue field on the right, all surrounded by a blue ring inscribed with the words \"ALFA\" at the top and \"MILANO\" at the bottom.[51] In honour of the King of Italy, the two words were separated by two figure-eight knots\u2014named Savoy knots in Italian, and symbols of the then-reigning House of Savoy. Originally solid brass, the lettering was changed to white enamel in 1913.[52] In 1918, after the company had been bought by Nicola Romeo, the wording \"ALFA\" was replaced with \"ALFA-ROMEO\". In 1925, to commemorate the victory of the Alfa Romeo P2 in the inaugural World Manufacturers' Championship of 1925, a silver metal laurel wreath was added around the badge, used (in varying form) until 1982.[48][53] The addition of the wreath had enlarged the badge to 75\u00a0mm (3.0\u00a0in) diameter; in 1930 it was reduced back to 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in).[51] In 1946, after the abolition of the monarchy and proclamation of the Italian Republic, the figure-eight knots of the Savoy were replaced with two curvy lines.[54] Concurrently the badge was completely redesigned, and further reduced in size to 54\u00a0mm (2.1\u00a0in), a diameter unchanged ever since.[51] Made of stamped steel, the new badge bore the traditional elements\u2014the scripts, the cross, a newly stylized biscione and a thin laurel wreath\u2014embossed in antique silver, over a uniform Alfa Red background, which had replaced the blue, white and light blue fields. This red-and-metal badge was used until 1950, when the company switched back to a traditionally enamelled and coloured one; in 1960 the badge was changed from brass to plastic, without substantial differences in design.[54] At the beginning of the 1970s the all-new Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco plant (near Naples) was completed. When in 1972 the Alfasud produced there became the first Alfa Romeo passenger car manufactured outside Milan, the word \"Milano\", the curved lines and the hyphen between \"Alfa\" and \"Romeo\" were eliminated from the badge on all Alfa Romeos.[54] At the same time it was redesigned, most notably acquiring a modernised biscione and type face. After a mild restyling in 1982, which deleted the wreath and changed lettering and all chrome details to gold, this iteration of the badge remained in use until 2015.[55] On 24 June 2015, 105th anniversary of the company, a new logo was unveiled at a press event at the Alfa Romeo Museum; together with the Alfa Romeo Giulia as part of the brand's relaunch plan.[56] The redesign was carried out by Robilant Associati, who had previously reworked several other Fiat Group logos\u2014including Fiat Automobiles' and Lancia's.[57] The logo colors have been reduced from four to three: the green of the biscione, the red of the cross, and the dark blue of the surrounding ring. Other changes are a new serif type face, and the absence of the split white and light blue fields, replaced by a single silver textured background. Since 1923, the quadrifoglio logo (also called the 'cloverleaf') has been the symbol of Alfa Romeo racing cars and since WWII, it has also been used to designate the higher trim models of the range. The quadrifoglio is usually placed on the side panels of the car, above or behind the front wheels\u2014on the front wings in the case of modern vehicles. The logo consists of a green cloverleaf with four leaves, contained with a white triangle. The quadrifoglio has been used on Alfa Romeo cars since the death of Ugo Sivocci in 1923. As a friend of Enzo Ferrari, Sivocci was hired by Alfa Romeo in 1920 to drive in the four-man works team\u2014Alfa Corse\u2014with Antonio Ascari, Giuseppe Campari, and Enzo Ferrari. Sivocci was thought to have enormous experience, but often hampered by bad luck and considered the eternal second-placer. To banish his bad luck, when the Targa Florio came around, the driver painted a white square with a green four-leaf clover (the quadrifoglio) in the centre of the grille of his car. Sivocci had immediate success, crossing the finish line first. The quadrifoglio subsequently became the symbol of the racing Alfa Romeos with the victory at the Targa Florio. Almost as if to prove the magic effects of this symbol, Sivocci was killed while testing Merosi's new P1 at Monza, a few months after winning the Targa Florio. The Salerno driver's P1, which went off the track on a bend, did not have the quadrifoglio. Since this period in 1923, the bodies of Alfa Romeo racing cars have been adorned with the quadrifoglio as a lucky charm. The white square was replaced with a triangle in memory of Ugo Sivocci.[58] The first road car to bear the quadrifoglio was the 1963 Alfa Romeo Giulia TI Super, a variant of the Giulia saloon car devised for competition but put regularly on sale; it had green four-leaf clovers on its front wings, without the triangle. In the 1970s \"Quadrifoglio Verde\" or \"Green Cloverleaf\" became the trim level for each model's sportiest variant, equipped with the most powerful engine. The Alfasud, Sprint, 33, 75, 164 and 145 all had Quadrifoglio Verde versions. Also in the 1970s and through the 1980s golden four-leaf clover badges were used to denote the most luxurious and well-equipped variants of Alfa Romeo cars, named \"Quadrifoglio Oro\" or \"Gold Cloverleaf\". The Alfasud, Alfetta, Alfa 6, 90 and 33 had Quadrifoglio Oro versions. In recent times the quadrifoglio was revived on the 2007 Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and Spider eight-cylinder sports cars. With the current Alfa Romeo MiTo and Giulietta the Quadrifoglio Verde was reinstated as the sportiest trim level in the range, and green four-leaf clovers on the front wings are once again the hallmark of high-performance Alfa Romeos. Alfa Romeo's 2016 sport sedan, the all-new Giulia, will be launched first in Quadrifoglio trim before the release of the base models. Starting with the high-end model wearing that historic signature emblem, Alfa Romeo strives to reconquer the North American market after decades of absence. Alfa Romeo has been involved with motor racing since 1911, when it entered two 24 HP models on Targa Florio competition. In the 1920s and 30s it scored wins at many races and motoring events such as Targa Florio, Mille Miglia and Le Mans. Great success continued with Formula One, Prototypes, Touring and Fast Touring. Private drivers also entered some rally competitions, with good results. Alfa Romeo has competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries Alfa Corse, Autodelta and private entries. Alfa Romeo's factory racing team was outsourced to Enzo Ferrari's Scuderia Ferrari between 1933 and 1938. Drivers included Tazio Nuvolari, who won the 1935 German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring. Alfa Romeo have been in a technical partnership with the Sauber F1 Team since 2018 and are competing in the 2019 Formula One season as Alfa Romeo Racing. According to the late Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne, in order to reap economies of scale, all new Alfa Romeo models will be made from the same basic platform. Even Maserati will share components with some Alfas.[59] During the 1990s, Alfa Romeo moved car production to other districts in Italy. The Pomigliano d\u2019Arco plant produced the 155, followed by the 145 and the 146, while the Arese plant manufactured the 164 and new Spider and GTV. The 156 was launched in 1997, and became quite successful for Alfa Romeo; in 1998 it was voted \"Car of the Year\". The same year a new flagship, the 166 (assembled in Rivalta, near Turin) was launched. At the beginning of the third millennium, the 147 was released, which won the prestigious title of \"Car of the Year 2001\". In 2003 the Arese factory was closed. The Arese factory today hosts almost nothing and is nearly abandoned. What remains are some offices and the Alfa Romeo Historical Museum, a must-see for Alfa Romeo fans. In the 1960s, the main Alfa Romeo seat was moved from inside Milan to a very large and nearby area extending over the municipalities of Arese, Lainate and Garbagnate Milanese. However, since then the Alfa seat is known to be in Arese, since the offices and the main entrance of the area are there. In the late 1960s, a number of European automobile manufacturers established facilities in South Africa to assemble right hand drive vehicles. Fiat and other Italian manufacturers established factories along with these other manufacturers, Alfa-Romeos were assembled in Brits, outside Pretoria in the Transvaal Province of South Africa. With the imposition of sanctions by western powers in the 1970s and 1980s, South Africa became self-sufficient, and in car production came to rely more and more on the products from local factories. This led to a remarkable set of circumstances where between 1972 and 1989, South Africa had the greatest number of Alfa Romeos on the road outside of Italy. Even stranger, Alfa Romeos Brits plant was used from March 1983[60] until 1985 to build Daihatsu Charades for local consumption, but also for export to Italy in order to skirt Italian limits on Japanese imports.[61] In late 1985, with the impending Fiat takeover and an international boycott of the South African Apartheid government, Alfa Romeo withdrew from the market and closed the plant. Tons of valuable parts were then bulldozed into the ground to escape paying import duties.[citation needed] ALFA 24 HP (1910\u20131914) ALFA 15 HP (1911\u20131913) ALFA 40/60 HP (1913\u20131914) ALFA 20/30 HP (1914\u20131922) ALFA Grand Prix (1914) G1 (1921\u20131923) RL (1922\u20131927) RM (1923\u20131925) P2 (1924\u20131930) 6C 1500 (1927\u20131929) 6C 1750 (1929\u20131933) Tipo A (1931) 8C (1931\u20131939) P3 (1932\u20131935) 6C 2300 (1933\u20131938) 12C (1936\u20131937) 16C Bimotore (1936) 6C 2500 (1938\u20131952) Tipo 512 (1940) 430 (1942\u20131950) 158/159 (1938\u20131951) 450/455 (1947\u20131959) 1900 (1950\u20131959) BAT 5, 7 og 9 (1952\u20131955) Matta (1952\u20131954) Disco Volante (1952\u20131953) Romeo (1954\u20131983) Giulietta (1954\u20131965) 2000 (1958\u20131962) Giulietta SS (1959\u20131977) 2600 (1961\u20131968) Giulia (1962\u20131977) TZ (1963\u20131965) TZ2 (1965\u20131967) GTA (1965\u20131969) Gran Sport (1965\u20131967) GT 1300 Junior Z (1965\u20131977) Spider (1966\u20131993) 1750 GT Veloce (1967\u20131972) 2000 (1967\u20131972) 33 Stradale (1967\u20131969) Montreal (1970\u20131977) Alfasud (1971\u20131989) Alfetta (1972\u20131987) Giulietta (1977\u20131985) Alfa 6 (1979\u20131986) 33 (1983\u20131995) 90 (1984\u20131987) 75 (1985\u20131992) 164 (1987\u20131998) SZ (1989\u20131991) 145 (1994\u20132000) 146 (1995\u20132000) GTV (1994\u20132004) 156 (1998-2005) 166 (1999\u20132007) 147 (2000\u20132010) GT (2003\u20132010) 159 (2004\u20132011) Brera (2005\u20132010) 8C Competizione (2007\u20132010) MiTo (2008\u20132018) Giulietta (2010\u2013present) 4C (2013\u2013present) Giulia (2016\u2013present) Stelvio (2017\u2013present) The Giulietta is a five-door, small family car officially revealed at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show.[63] It replaced the 147. The 4C is a small, lightweight rear wheel drive two seater coup\u00e9 sports car. The car was revealed as concept car at the 81st Geneva Motor Show in 2011.[64] The production version was launched to the European market at the 83rd Geneva Motor show in 2013 and was launched to the American market at the Los Angeles Motor show at the end of November 2013. The new generation Giulia was unveiled to the press at the Museo Storico Alfa Romeo in Arese, on 24 June 2015. This coincided with the company's 105th anniversary and saw the introduction of a revised logo. Sales is about 34,000 samples per year (2018). The Stelvio was unveiled at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. The Stelvio is Alfa Romeo's first production SUV that competes in the same category as the Porsche Macan, Jaguar F-Pace, Audi Q5, Mercedes-Benz GLC and BMW X3. It is current top Alfa sales with about 46,000 samples per year (2018). 1910\u20131920 24 HP 1910\u20131911 12 HP 1911\u20131920 15 HP 1913\u20131922 40\u201360 HP 1911 15 HP Corsa 1913 40\u201360 HP Corsa 1914 Grand Prix 1921\u20131922 20\u201330 HP 1920\u20131921 G1 1921-1921 G2 1922\u20131927 RL 1923\u20131925 RM 1927\u20131929 6C 1500 1929\u20131933 6C 1750 1922 RL Super Sport 1923 RL Targa Florio 1923 P1 1924 P2 1928 6C 1500 MMS 1929 6C 1750 Super Sport 1931\u20131934 8C 2300 1933-1933 6C 1900 1934\u20131937 6C 2300 1935\u20131939 8C 2900 1939\u20131950 6C 2500 1931 Tipo A 1931 8C 2300 Monza 1932 Tipo B (P3) 1935 Bimotore 1935 8C 35 1935 8C 2900A 1936 12C 36 1937 12C 37 1937 6C 2300B Mille Miglia 1937 8C 2900B Mille Miglia 1938 308 1938 312 1938 316 1938 158 1939 6C 2500 Super Sport Corsa 1948 6C 2500 Competizione 1950\u20131958 1900 1951\u20131953 Matta 1954\u20131962 Giulietta 1958\u20131962 2000 1959\u20131964 Dauphine 1951 159 1952 6C 3000 CM 1962\u20131968 2600 1962\u20131976 Giulia Saloon 1963\u20131967 Giulia TZ 1963\u20131977 Giulia Sprint 1963\u20131966 Giulia Sprint Speciale 1965\u20131967 Gran Sport Quattroruote 1965\u20131971 GTA 1963\u20131965 Giulia Spider 1966\u20131993 Spider 1967\u20131969 33 Stradale 1967\u20131977 1750/2000 Berlina 1960 Giulietta SZ 1963 Giulia TZ 1965 GTA 1965 Tipo 33 1968 33/2 1969 33/3 1970\u20131977 Montreal 1972\u20131983 Alfasud 1972\u20131984 Alfetta saloon 1974\u20131987 Alfetta GT/GTV 1976\u20131989 Alfasud Sprint 1977\u20131985 Nuova Giulietta 1979\u20131986 Alfa 6 1972 33/4 1973 33TT12 1976 33SC12 1979 177 1979 179 1983\u20131994 33 1984\u20131987 Arna 1984\u20131987 90 1985\u20131992 75 1987\u20131998 164 1989\u20131993 SZ/RZ 1982 182 1983 183 1984 184 1985 185 1992\u20131998 155 1994\u20132000 145 1995\u20132000 146 1993/4\u20132004 GTV/Spider 1996\u20132005 156 1996\u20132007 166 1992 155 GTA 1993 155 V6 TI 1998 156 D2 1999 GTV Cup 2002 156 GTA Super 2000 2003 156 Super 2000 2000\u20132010 147 2007\u20132009 8C Competizione 2008\u20132010 8C Spider 2003\u20132010 GT 2005\u20132010 Brera 2004\u20132011 159 2006\u20132010 Spider 2008\u20132018 MiTo 2003 147 GTA Cup  In the 1960s Alfa Romeo became famous for its small cars and models specifically designed for the Italian police and Carabinieri; among them the \"Giulia Super\" and the 2600 Sprint GT. The colours of the Alfa Romeos used by the Polizia were/are green/blue with white stripes and writing, known as \"Pantera\" (Panther), enhancing the aggressive look of the Alfa (particularly the Giulia series), while the Carabinieri Alfas are dark blue with white roofs and red stripes, known as the \"Gazzella\" (Gazelle) denoting the speed and agility of these \"Pattuglie\" (patrol cars). However, the term \"Pantera\" became used interchangeably and the image helped create a no-nonsense, determined and respected perception by the general public of the men that drove these cars, true to their history. Since then, Alfas remain the chosen mount of the Carabinieri (arm of the Italian armed forces seconded only partly for civilian policing purposes), Polizia Autostradale (highway police), Guardia di Finanza (fiscal law enforcement) and the conventional police service (Polizia). Successively, the following Alfa Romeo Berlinas have found favour for Italian police and government employment[65] Since the 1960s, the Italian Prime Minister has used Alfa Romeos (and lately the new Maserati Quattroporte) as preferred government limousines. The 164 and 166 have found particular employment in the last two decades. In 1930 Alfa Romeo presented a light truck in addition to heavy LCVs based on B\u00fcssing constructions.[67] In the Second World War Alfa Romeo also built trucks for the Italian army (\"35 tons anywhere\") and later also for the German Wehrmacht. After the war, commercial motor vehicle production was resumed. In co-operation with FIAT and Saviem starting from the 1960s different light truck models were developed. The production of heavy LCVs in Italy was terminated in 1967. Heavy trucks continued to be built for a few years in Brazil by Alfa Romeo subsidiary F\u00e1brica Nacional de Motores under the name FNM. The last Alfa Romeo vans were the Alfa Romeo AR6 and AR8, rebadged versions of Iveco Daily and Fiat Ducato. The company also produced trolleybuses for many systems in Italy, Latin America,[68] Sweden,[69] Greece,[70] Germany, Turkey and South Africa. Later, Alfa Romeo concentrated only on passenger car manufacturing. Design has always played a large role in the history of Alfa Romeo. There have been many Alfa Romeo concept cars, often made by famous design houses and designers. The BAT series of concepts from the 1950s was a collaboration with the Italian design house Bertone. Other famous Italian coachbuilders and design houses like Pininfarina, Bertone, Zagato and ItalDesign-Giugiaro have also played a great role in Alfa Romeo's history, and even today some of models are designed and constructed by them. Although Alfa Romeo is best known as automobile manufacturer it has also produced commercial vehicles of various size, railway locomotives,[5] tractors, buses, trams, compressors, generators, an electric cooker,[73] marine and aircraft engines. An Alfa engine was first used on an aircraft in 1910 on the Santoni-Franchini biplane.[74] In 1932 Alfa Romeo built its first real aircraft engine, the D2 (240\u00a0bhp), fitted to Caproni 101 D2. In the 1930s when Alfa Romeo engines were used for aircraft on a larger scale; the Savoia Marchetti SM.74, Savoia-Marchetti SM.75, Savoia-Marchetti SM.79, Savoia Marchetti SM.81 and Cant Z506B Airone all used Alfa Romeo manufactured engines.[75] In 1931, a competition was arranged where Tazio Nuvolari drove his Alfa Romeo 8C 3000 Monza against a Caproni Ca.100 airplane.[76] Alfa Romeo built various aircraft engines during the Second World War; the best known was the RA.1000 RC 41-I Monsone, a licensed version of the Daimler-Benz DB 601. This engine made it possible to build efficient fighter aircraft like the Macchi C.202 Folgore for the Italian army. After the Second World War Alfa Romeo produced engines for Fiat, Aerfer and Ambrosini. In the 1960s Alfa Romeo mainly focused upgrading and maintaining Curtiss-Wright, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce and General Electric aircraft engines. Alfa Romeo also built Italy's first turbine engine, installed to the Beechcraft King Air. Alfa Romeo's Avio division was sold to Aeritalia in 1988,[77] from 1996 it was part of Fiat Avio.[78] Alfa Avio was also part of developing team to the new T700-T6E1 engine to the NHI NH90 helicopter.[79] Alfa Romeo also produced marine engines. The first marine engine was produced in 1929. Later, for three consecutive years: 1937-1938-1939 with remarkable affirmations, Alfa Romeo demonstrated its constructive efficiency by contributing to the development of marine engines. During the years Alfa Romeo has been marketed with different slogans like: \"The family car that wins races\" used in the 1950s in Alfa Romeo 1900 marketing campaign, \"racing since 1911\" used on most 1960s Alfa advertisements,[80] In the 1970s the Alfa Romeo 1750 GTV was marketed as \"if this kind of handling is good enough for our racing cars, it's good enough for you.\"[81] The Giulia Sprint GTA was marketed as \"The car you drive to work is a champion\".[82] More recent slogans used are \"Mediocrity is a sin\", \"Driven by Passion\", \"Cuore Sportivo\", \"Beauty is not enough\" and present day \"Without heart we would be mere machines\". Also other more recent ones are: \"It's not a car, it's an Alfa Romeo.\", one of them after a couple argue in Italian. As part of its marketing policy, Alfa Romeo sponsors a number of sporting events, such as the Mille Miglia rally.[83] It has sponsored the SBK Superbike World Championship and Ducati Corse since 2007, and the Goodwood Festival of Speed for many years, and was one of the featured brands in 2010 when Alfa Romeo celebrated its 100th anniversary.[84][85] The Alfa Romeo Giulietta has been used since Monza 2010 race as the safety car in Superbike World Championship events.[86] Alfa Romeo has been also shirt sponsor of Eintracht Frankfurt football club in period between 2013 and 2016. In 2002, Alfa Romeo I, the first Alfa Romeo super maxi yacht was launched. It finished first in at least 74 races including the 2002 Sydney\u2014Hobart Race.[87] Alfa Romeo II, commissioned in 2005, measures 30 metres (98\u00a0ft) LOA. It set a new elapsed-time record for monohulls in the 2009 Transpac race, of 5 days, 14 hours, 36 minutes, 20 seconds[88] It finished first in at least 140 races. In mid-2008 Alfa Romeo III was launched for competitive fleet racing under the IRC rule. Alfa Romeo III measures 21.4 metres (70\u00a0ft) LOA and features interior design styled after the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione.[89] The BBC motoring show Top Gear repeatedly argued the significance of owning an Alfa Romeo car as a car enthusiast, stating that \"You can't be a true petrolhead if you have never owned/or wanted to own an Alfa Romeo\". Presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May continuously praised Alfas for their beauty and driving characteristics even though Italian cars had a long-term bad reputation for unreliability. They argued that you (the owner) build a personal relationship with the car despite all of its mechanical faults. Both Clarkson and May have previously owned Alfas (a GTV6 for Clarkson and an Alfa 164 for May) and both have stated that they regretted selling their Alfas the most. During Super Bowl LI, Alfa Romeo ran three commercials throughout the game; the brand was the sole marque advertised by FCA during the game, after exclusively focusing on its Jeep brand at Super Bowl 50.[90][31] In February 2013, Alfa Romeo sponsored University of St Andrews FS fashion show[91] which saw luxury fashion designer Luke Archer and milliner George Jenkins win with their Alfa Romeo inspired garments.

            "text": "Alitalia \u2013 Societ\u00e0 Aerea Italiana (Alitalia \u2013 Italian Air Company), operating as Alitalia (Italian:\u00a0[ali\u02c8ta\u02d0lja]), is the flag carrier of Italy.[6] The company has its head office in Fiumicino, Rome, Italy.[7] Its main hub is Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport, Rome, and a secondary is Linate Airport, Milan.  Other focus airports are Catania\u2013Fontanarossa Airport, Milan Malpensa Airport, Palermo Airport and Naples Airport.[2] In 2018, it was the twelfth-largest airline in Europe.  The name \"Alitalia\" is an Italian portmanteau of the words ali (wings), and Italia (Italy).[8] On 2 May 2017, the airline went into administration after the Italian government formally approved the move.[9] In 2008, a group of investors formed the \"Compagnia Aerea Italiana\" (CAI) consortium to buy the bankrupt Alitalia \u2013 Linee Aeree Italiane (\"old\" Alitalia) and to merge these with Air One, another bankrupt Italian carrier.[10][11] On 30 October 2008, CAI offered \u20ac1 billion to acquire parts of the bankrupt airline, amidst pilots' and flight crew members' opposition to labour agreements.[12] On 19 November 2008, CAI's offer was accepted by the bankruptcy administrator of Alitalia with the permission of the Italian government, at the time the majority shareholder of the bankrupt airline.[13] Alitalia's profitable assets were transferred to CAI on 12 December 2008 after CAI paid \u20ac1.05 billion, consisting of \u20ac427 million in cash and the assumption of responsibility for \u20ac625 million in Alitalia debt.[14] A USA diplomatic cable disclosed in 2011 summarised the operation as follows: \"Under the guise of a rather quaint (and distinctly un-EU) desire to maintain the Italian-ness of the company, a group of wealthy Berlusconi cronies was enticed into taking over the healthy portions of Alitalia, leaving its debts to the Italian taxpayers. The rules of bankruptcy were changed in the middle of the game to meet the government's needs. Berlusconi pulled this one off, but his involvement probably cost the Italian taxpayers a lot of money.\"[15] On 13 January 2009, the \"new\" Alitalia launched operations. The owners of Compagnia Aerea Italiana sold 25% of the company's shares to Air France-KLM for \u20ac322 million. Air France-KLM also obtained an option, subject to certain conditions, to purchase additional shares after 2013.[16] The \"new\" Alitalia has not claimed the old Alitalia's history as its own, as can be seen in official documents regarding the new \"Alitalia Group\".[17] Instead, they stressed that they were a totally different company: they chose not to recognize benefits such as discounted tickets to former Alitalia-LAI workers and refused to honour passengers' claims against the old Alitalia.[18] The new Alitalia does not own many of its operating airplanes. (Alitalia-LAI had owned all of its airplanes.) Almost every plane that CAI had acquired from the old Alitalia was sold or decommissioned. Alitalia-CAI airplanes are leased mostly from Aircraft Purchase Fleet (it),[19] an Irish company owned by Carlo Toto, the former owner of the bankrupt[10] Air One, which was merged in 2008 into Alitalia-CAI when the new company was founded. In January 2010, Alitalia celebrated its first anniversary since the relaunch. It carried 22 million passengers in its first year of operations.[20] In 2011, 25 million passengers were carried.[21] On 1 February 2010, it was announced that Alitalia crew would go on a four-hour strike over wages. This was the first strike action for Alitalia since the relaunch.[22] On 11 February 2010, Alitalia announced that, starting from March 2010, it would use Air One as a low-fare airline (\"Smart Carrier\"), with operations based at Milan Malpensa Airport, focused on short-haul leisure routes. It was predicted that the subsidiary would handle 2.4 million passengers by 2012.[23] In 2011, 1.4 million passengers were carried by the subsidiary.[21] Although operations were initially to be concentrated at Milan Malpensa, Air One later operated from Milan-Malpensa, Venice-Marco Polo, Pisa and Catania as of January 2013. On 12 February 2011, information was released about a possible merger between Alitalia and Meridiana Fly, another Italian carrier.[24] The merger did not occur. On 23 February 2011, Alitalia and ENAC announced the introduction of a safety card written in braille and characters in 3-D relief, which is the first of its kind.[25] On 25 January 2012, Alitalia signed memoranda of understanding with two other Italian airlines, Blue Panorama and Wind Jet, and said to have started processes \"aimed at achieving integration\" with them.[26] By the end of July 2012, the Italian antitrust authority allowed Alitalia to acquire Wind Jet, but in return Alitalia would have to cede slots on domestic routes. Faced with this, Alitalia cancelled the plans a few days later in August 2012.[27] On 3 May 2013, in a sting codenamed \"Operation Clean Holds\", police made 49 arrests at Rome's Fiumicino airport, with another 37 in Italian airports including Bari, Bologna, Milan Linate, Naples, Palermo and Verona. All were Alitalia employees caught on camera and most were charged with aggravated theft and damage.[28] In late 2013, facing bankruptcy, the loss of a major fuel supplier, and a possible grounding by Italy's civil aviation authority, the airline announced a \u20ac500 million rescue package which included a \u20ac75 million investment by the Italian state-owned postal operator.[29] In June 2014, the Abu Dhabi-based UAE national airline Etihad Airways announced it was taking a 49% stake in Alitalia.[30] On 30 September 2014, Alitalia's budget subsidiary Air One ceased flight operations. On 1 January 2015, Alitalia-CAI formally passed its operations to Alitalia-SAI, a new entity owned 49% by Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways and 51% owned by the former Italian stakeholders of Alitalia-CAI.[30][31] In May 2015, Alitalia announced it would terminate its partnership with Air France-KLM in 2017, stating that there were no longer enough advantages from the joint venture to keep it up.[32] In February 2016, Alitalia announced that in late March 2016 it would cancel most of its routes from Pisa, including Moscow, Prague, Berlin, Catania and Tirana. Alitalia decided to continue flying to Olbia and Rome.[33] On 25 April 2017, after Alitalia employees rejected job-cuts proposal aimed at reducing costs, the airline announced that it will start going through a bankruptcy process, beginning with the appointment of an administrator.[34] The Italian government permitted Alitalia to file for bankruptcy on 2 May 2017.[35] On 17 May 2017, after the government had ruled out nationalizing the airline, it was officially put up for sale to be auctioned off.[36] In June, EasyJet expressed interest in purchasing the airline.[37] Ryanair also expressed interest but dropped its bid after the chaos caused by Ryanair's flight cancellations.[38] In 2018, Delta Air Lines, EasyJet and Italian railway company Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane lodged formal expressions of interest to acquire Alitalia;[39] talks between the parties were opened in February 2019.[40] In March 2019, EasyJet announced that it had withdrawn from the discussions.[41] After the official visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Rome, China Eastern Airlines expressed interest in Alitalia's rescue plan and could spend up to \u20ac100 million in exchange for a 10% stake.[42] Delta Air Lines states to Reuters that it is ready to invest in Alitalia but 10% stake is the right way for them to do so.[43] Alitalia's continued loss-making over several years has led to various changes of ownership and status. As of August 2019, the company (Alitalia \u2013 Societ\u00e0 Aerea Italiana S.p.A.) and its subsidiary Cityliner (Alitalia Cityliner S.p.A.) are in Extraordinary Administration (EA), by virtue of decrees of the Ministry of Economic Development on 2 May and 12 May 2017 respectively, and were declared insolvent on 11 May and 26 May 2017 respectively.[9][44] Luigi Gubitosi, Prof. Enrico Laghi and Prof. Stefano Paleari were appointed as Extraordinary Commissioners of the Companies in EA.[44] In terms of ownership, the current shareholders appear to be Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (the Italian state railway company) with 35%, the Italian Ministry of Economy maintaining a further 15% and Delta Air Lines providing technical expertise with a minority 10% stake. The now-majority stakeholder Ferrovie dello Stato is reported to be seeking investor(s) to provide a 40% stake.[45] Historical figures for Alitalia's performance, before the 2015 reorganisation, were: ND = No Data The available business and operating results of the new group (Alitalia \u2013 Societ\u00e0 Aerea Italiana S.p.A.), including Alitalia CityLiner, that commenced trading on 1 January 2015, are (as at year ending 31 December): Alitalia's head office is located in Building Alfa at Via Alberto Nassetti in Fiumicino, Province of Rome.[7] The corporate headquarters was designed by AMDL, a Milan-based architecture firm.[64] The head office was previously in a building at Piazza Almerico da Schio, also in Fiumicino.[65] A variety of different slogans have been used by Alitalia: In 2014, the company adopted a new slogan[72] Alitalia serves 97 destinations (as of October 2019).  Alitalia's hub is at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport.  Four other Italian airports are focus cities.[2] Alitalia codeshares with the following airlines:[73] Alitalia has been in the SkyTeam alliance since 2009; Alitalia-LAI originally joined in 2001.[85] Alitalia has since arranged code-share agreements with SkyTeam members, allowing passengers to fly to numerous destinations (with some or all segments operated by airlines other than Alitalia) using a single Alitalia ticket.[86] In July 2010, Alitalia also joined Air France, KLM and Delta's transatlantic Joint Venture, meaning that the profits from flights across the Atlantic are shared between the four airlines.[87] As of October 2019, the Alitalia mainline fleet (excluding subsidiary Alitalia CityLiner) consists of the following aircraft:[88][89] Between 2009 and 2011, Alitalia renewed its fleet with 34 new aircraft, while 26 older planes were retired. The renewal process ended in early 2013.[21] These new planes are not owned by Alitalia itself, but are leased mostly from Aircraft Purchase Fleet, an Irish leasing company created by former Air One owner Carlo Toto primarily to purchase the new Alitalia fleet.[19] Following the Air One merger, the entire fleet that was not already leased from other lessors, plus the former Air One fleet that was owned by Air One outright, came under the ownership of APF, a subsidiary of Toto's Italian conglomerate Toto Holding. The entire fleet, except the two new A330s, is now on the Irish registry instead of the Italian registry. Alitalia has four classes of service:[100] Economy, Premium Economy, Business Class Medium Haul and Magnifica.[101] The airline's frequent-flyer program is named \"MilleMiglia\" (thousand miles), and is part of the SkyTeam alliance program, allowing passengers to collect miles and redeem them with free tickets across the whole alliance.[102] It also grants access to Alitalia's Privilege clubs, Ulisse, Freccia Alata, and Freccia Alata Plus, depending on the number of miles collected in a year, with various advantages depending on the club. These clubs give access to SkyTeam Elite (Ulisse) and SkyTeam Elite+ (Freccia Alata, Freccia Alata plus).[102] As of 3 February 2015 Etihad Airways has acquired a 75 per cent stake in Alitalia Loyalty S.p.A, the owner and operator of MilleMiglia, Alitalia's frequent flyer program, with Alitalia retaining the remaining 25 per cent stake.   Alitalia Loyalty is now part of Global Loyalty Company (GLC), a loyalty and lifestyle company that allows Etihad Airways and its partners to target the global loyalty market more effectively, whilst driving technology and back office synergies. GLC also consists of Etihad Airways' Etihad Guest. Together, Etihad Guest, topbonus, JetPrivilege and MilleMiglia have a combined total of 14 million members worldwide.[103] On 18 December 2018, Alitalia and Global Loyalty Company LLC have signed an agreement according to which Global Loyalty Company LLC has sold the 75% of Alitalia Loyalty S.p.A. to the Italian carrier.[104] Listed here are incidents since Alitalia-CAI's launch of operations on 13 January 2009:  Media related to Alitalia at Wikimedia Commons  ",

            "text": "Alpinestars is a manufacturer of clothing and protective gear for motorsports and action sports founded in 1963, and located in Asolo, Italy. Its lines include specialized products for MotoGP, motocross, motorcycling, Formula One, WEC and NASCAR, mountain Biking and surfing, and motorsports-themed, non-sports clothing, with fashion design centers in Italy and California. Founded in 1963 by Sante Mazzarolo in Asolo, Italy, the company started out making hiking and ski boots, but quickly shifted its focus to making boots for motocross racing, and road racing boots shortly thereafter. The company's name comes from the English translation of the Italian mountain flower Stella Alpina (Edelweiss), which grows high in the mountains around the area where the company was founded. They sponsored motorsport world champions such as Roger DeCoster, Kenny Roberts, Mick Doohan and Marc M\u00e1rquez. During the 1990s the company branched out into manufacturing all types of technical protective gear for motorcycling such as gloves, jackets, and full leather suits. The company has been headed by Sante's son, Gabriele Mazzarolo, since 1993. There are offices in Los Angeles and Bangkok while the original headquarters and main research & development facility remain in Northern Italy. Alpinestars leather suits and protective gear are worn MotoGP World Champions Marc M\u00e1rquez, Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo, and World Superbike Champions Ben Spies and Troy Corser.  Alpinestars' motocross gear is used by AMA and World Motocross champions Marvin Musquin, Tyla Rattray, David Philippaerts, Christophe Pourcel, and Ryan Villopoto. In 2011 Alpinestars developed the Tech Air Race System, an electronic airbag safety system that uses a data logging unit and dual charge inflation module.[1] It was used in the MotoGP and World Superbike championships and was intended to eventually be worn by street riders. In June 2013 Marc M\u00e1rquez crashed at a speed of around 337\u00a0km/h (209\u00a0mph) while wearing the airbag suit and did not sustain serious injuries.[2] Alpinestars developed flame and heat retardant Nomex fire suits, footwear, gloves, and underwear for Formula One and NASCAR, which has been worn by recent champions Michael Schumacher, Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso and Jimmie Johnson. Top Gear's the Stig wears a white Alpinestars race suit, shoes and gloves.[3] Alpinestars made mountain bikes until 1996.[4] MotoGP ",

It was taken over by Leonardo Spa.  In 2011, Leonardo S.p.A. sold 45% stake in Ansaldo Energia to First Reserve Corporation. In 2013, the Fondo Strategico Italiano acquired an 85% share of the company. It then sold a 40% share to Shanghai Electric Corporation.[3] Ansaldo Energia is a producer of thermoelectric power plants, operating on international markets for customers ranging from Public Administration to Independent Power Producers and Industrial Clients. Ansaldo Energia covers the entire power generation spectrum with a combination of plant engineering, manufacturing and service activities. It has an installed capacity exceeding 166,000 MW in over 90 countries for thermal electric and hydroelectric plants.

            "text": "Hitachi Rail STS (previously Ansaldo Signalling and Transportation Systems or Ansaldo STS) is an Italian transportation company owned by Hitachi with a global presence in the field of railway signalling and integrated transport systems for passenger traffic (Railway / Mass Transit) and freight operations. Hitachi Rail STS plans, designs, manufactures, installs and commissions signaling systems, components and high technologies for the management and control of newly built or upgraded railways, transit and freight lines worldwide. Headquartered in Genoa, Italy, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi. It was previously listed on the Borsa Italiana and was a component of the benchmark FTSE Italia Mid Cap Index. Providing design, manufacture, installation, integration and maintenance of a wide range of train control systems and equipment dedicated to safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability, Hitachi Rail STS employs 4,327 people worldwide. The company was founded as Ansaldo STS in 2006 through the merger of several major international railway companies.[3][4] The company\u2019s namesake comes from the Italian company Gio. Ansaldo & C., founded in 1853 in Genoa, Italy by Giovanni Ansaldo. Gio. Ansaldo & C.began as a steam locomotive producer, which diversified into shipbuilding and electrical and nuclear energy production.[5] In 1881 the US company Union Switch & Signal (US&S) was founded by George Westinghouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from the assets of the Interlocking Switch & Signal Company (interlocking controls) and the Union Electric Signal Company. The latter was founded by the American engineer and inventor William Robinson, the father of track circuit systems. In 1988 US&S merged with Ansaldo STS.[6] In Europe, Ansaldo STS expanded acquiring the French company Compagnie des Signaux pour Chemins de fer (CSE) in 1996. Founded in 1902 by Mr. Fernand Cumont with the support of the financial group Empain, CSE built the first lines of the Paris metro: the maintenance of these lines continues until today. In 1920 CSE (independent since 1912) was renamed into Company and Business Electrical Signals (CSEE), concentrating on rail signaling and electrical manufacturing, contributing to create SAGEM and later (1996) entering in the Ansaldo Signal group. In 1993 the parent company Ansaldo SpA was merged into the Finmeccanica holding, a state-owned entity privatized during the same year. In 2001, Ansaldo SpA\u2019s transportation business was separated and divided into three companies: AnsaldoBreda (rolling stock manufacturer); Ansaldo Segnalamento Ferroviario (signaling and rail traffic control automation); Ansaldo Trasporti Sistemi Ferroviari (transport systems design construction and maintenance). Ansaldo Segnalamento Ferroviario became the parent company of Ansaldo Signal (railway signalling), the owner of Union Switch & Signal and CSEE. In 2006 Ansaldo Trasporti Sistemi Ferroviari and Ansaldo Signal merged.[4]  It began trading on the Milan Stock exchange, with 60% of its shares publicly held and 40% owned by Finmeccanica S.p.A.[7] Both companies had their roots in the Ansaldo engineering conglomerate which was gradually absorbed by Finmeccanica. Ansaldo Trasporti Sistemi Ferroviari was created in 2000, acquiring certain units of Ansaldo Trasporti (which had been fully integrated into Finmeccanica) the following year.[4] The creation of Ansaldo STS was followed by a partial IPO in March 2006.[8] On 24 February 2015 Hitachi acquired Finmeccanica\u2019s 51% shareholding and initiated a tender offer for the remaining shares of the company.[9] In occasion of the Ordinary General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting on 2 November, Hitachi Rail Italy Investment completed the acquisition of the 40% of the share capital of Ansaldo STS. During the first meeting of the new Board of Directors, chaired by Alistair Dormer, Stefano Siragusa has been confirmed as Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the Company, with the powers to manage the Company and the Group. On March 2015, after the Public Tender Offer launch on the society and after the purchase of other shares at 10.5 euros each, Hitachi Rail Italy Investments arrived to 50.7% of the share capital.[10] Hitachi has a long term goal of integrating the company to provide a range of cars and signaling products and a manufacturing footprint in Europe. [11] Stefano Siragusa, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the Company, resigned on 31 March 2016 and remained in charge until 13 May 2016 when, on the occasion of the Shareholders\u2019 General Meeting the new Board of Directors were elected.[12] On 24 May, the new Board appointed Andrew Barr as new Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of Ansaldo STS. Andrew Barr was also granted the operational powers necessary for the management of the Company and the Group.[13] In October 2018, Hitachi agreed to buy Elliot Management's remaining 32% shareholding.[14]  Hitachi subsequently made a takeover offer for the remaining shares.  Following the announcement that Hitachi had gained a 99% shareholding on 22 January 2019[15][16], Ansaldo STS was officially delisted from Borsa Italiana and renamed Hitachi Rail STS on 30 January 2019.[17] The company's operations are split into two divisions: Freight Rail and Passenger Railway / Mass Transit. Major projects involving Hitachi Rail STS and its predecessor companies include the Copenhagen Metro, where it is responsible for the provision of rolling stock, Automatic Train Control, SCADA and other services;[18] and signalling on LGV Est in France and High Speed 1 in the United Kingdom.[18] The company also managed projects for signalling, train control and/or maintenance for the Metro systems of Paris,[19] Los Angeles, Rome,[20] Milan,[21] Hong Kong, Naples, Shenyang,[22] India,[20]  and Thessaloniki.[18] Hitachi Rail STS commissioned the first high-speed rail signaling system (TVM) for the first LGV line in France, in 1981, connecting Paris and Lyon. In 2005, Hitachi Rail STS set another landmark with the first high speed line running on ERTMS Level 2 (European Rail Traffic Management System) between Rome and Naples, Italy. As of 2013 over half of all high speed lines worldwide (excluding Japan) are equipped with Hitachi Rail STS signaling solutions.[23] In Europe, the company played a key role in the development and upgrade of ERTMS (level 1 and 2),[24] leading to the interoperability of different countries' rail networks. In the United States Hitachi Rail STS has supported the freight rail industry, dating back over 130 years. Hitachi Rail STS has products and systems with every Class I railroad in North America.[25] In Australia Hitachi Rail STS has supported the freight rail industry for more than 20 years and has most recently developed automated train management technology (AutoHaul) to support fully autonomous heavy-haul, long-distance rail systems and advanced signalling and telecommunications systems featuring satellite positioning, data radio & WiMax. Hitachi Rail STS's transit control systems build upon traditional signaling technology for a new generation of more advanced systems, i.e.: Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD)[31] system was developed by Union Switch & Signal at the Union Railroad Company in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, in 1966 starting the computer-aided dispatching in the industry. Today Hitachi Rail STS adopts the Optimizing Traffic Planner[32] as a late successor of the 1966 CAD. OTP is an advanced planning engine that solves complex logistics problems under changing operating conditions to maximize capacity and increase average velocity. Computational agents respond in real-time to updated CAD and field data, issuing new movement plans that account for current conditions and all operating rules and constraints. Applied off-line, OTP can minimize inherent conflict within a new timetable before the timetable is used in service. Applied on-line, OTP can produce significant capacity gains across a large freight oriented network. The company provides on-board and wayside components and systems, such as interlocking (MicroLok II), track circuits, switch machines (M-style), traditional and LED signals, Eurobalise, vital relays, hot wheel detectors, highway crossing mechanisms.

Having started as a manufacturer of bicycles it moved on to manufacture scooters and small-capacity motorcycles. In more recent times Aprilia has produced large sportbikes such as the 1,000\u00a0cc V-twin RSV Mille and the V4 RSV4.  Aprilia has enjoyed considerable success in road-racing.[1] Aprilia was founded after the Second World War by Cavaliere Alberto Beggio, as a bicycle production factory at Noale, Italy in the province of Venice. Alberto\u2019s son, Ivano Beggio, took over the helm of the company in 1968 and constructed a 50 cc \"motorcycle\" with a dozen or so[citation needed] collaborators. The first production Aprilia mopeds were named Colibr\u00ec, Daniela and Packi. Aprilia later produced a motocross bike in 1970 called the Scarabeo. Produced until the end of the 1970s, the Scarabeo came in 50 and 125 cc versions. In 1977 Ivan Alborghetti from Milan, Italy won the Italian 125 and 250 cc motocross championships on Aprilias. In 1978 Alborghetti closed the season with two third places in individual races and sixth place in the World Championship. In the 1980s Aprilia added enduro, trials and road bikes of between 50 and 600 cc. In 1981 Aprilia introduced the TL320 trials machine. In 1983 Aprilia launched to St 125 road bike. In 1984 Aprilia launched an improved model called STX, and an enduro, called the ET 50. In 1985, Aprilia started outsourcing engines for some models to the Austrian company Rotax. In 1985 Aprilia launched a 125 STX and 350 STX. In 1986 Aprilia launched the AF1; a small sports model, and the Tuareg; a large tanked bike for African rallies like the Dakar Rally. Aprilia factory rider Philippe Berlatier contended for the trials world championship reaching fifth place, and Loris Reggiani rode an Aprilia GP 250 with Rotax engine to sixth place in the road racing World Championship. Two seasons later, on August 30, 1987, at San Marino Grand Prix in Misano Loris Reggiani's AF1 won the first World Speed Championship. In 1990 Aprilia launched the Pegaso 600, a road bike derived from off-road mechanics. Later, in 1992 Aprilia rider Alessandro Gramigni won the World 125 Road Racing Championship title. Also in 1992, Tommy Ahvala won the World Trials Championship on an Aprilia Climber. Since then, Aprilia has 124 times won 125 and 250 cc class Grand Prix, 15 Road Racing World Championship titles, and 16 European speed titles. Many world champions started on Aprilia such as Biaggi, Capirossi, Gramigni, Locatelli, Sakata and Rossi. Also in the 1990s, Aprilia entered the scooter market starting in 1990 with Italy\u2019s first all-plastic scooter, the Amico. In 1992, Aprilia introduced the Amico LK and the two stroke Pegaso 125, both with catalytic converters. In 1993 Aprilia launched a large diameter wheel scooter reusing the name Scarabeo with a four-stroke, four-valve engine. Later Aprilia launched more scooters such as the Leonardo, the SR and the Gulliver. In 1995, Aprilia commissioned Philippe Starck to design the Mot\u00f2 which was shown in New York\u2019s Modern Art Museum. Also in 1995 Aprilia launched the two stroke RS 125 and RS 250 sports bikes. In 1998 Aprilia launched what is its current flagship model the RSV Mille, a 1000cc V-Twin Superbike, and the Falco, a 1000cc V-Twin sport tourer with emphasis on sport. Both bikes used a variation of a Rotax 1000cc engine. In 1999 Aprilia entered World Superbike Championship racing with its RSV Mille, and during 2000, Aprilia acquired Moto-Guzzi and Laverda, both historic heritage Italian marques. In 2000 Aprilia launched the 50\u00a0cc DiTech (Direct Injection Technology) two stroke engine for scooters which provides high mileage and low emissions, and also the RST Futura, a sport tourer, and the ETV 1000 Caponord; an adventure touring motorcycle. Both of these latter two motorcycles used a variation of the Rotax 1000\u00a0cc V-Twin. Most recently, in 2003, Aprilia launched the RSV Mille Tuono which was essentially an RSV Mille with motocross-style high handlebars and only a small headlight fairing. Most of the major motorcycle magazines picked it for the best bike of the year. In 2004 Aprilia was acquired by Piaggio & C. SpA, to form the world\u2019s fourth largest motorcycle group with 1.5 billion Euro in sales, an annual production capacity of over 600,000 vehicles, and a presence in 50 countries. With the acquisition by Piaggio, the new President of Aprilia is Roberto Colaninno (President of Piaggio & C.), and the Managing Director is Rocco Sabelli. The founder, Ivano Beggio, was the Honorary President and died on 13 March 2018.[2] On 15 August 2010, Aprilia became the most successful motorcycle racing brand in history, surpassing fellow Italian MV Agusta with a record 276th victory.[3] Despite being a relatively small company by global motorcycling standards, Aprilia is very active in motorcycle sports. It contested many Road Racing formulae, including the now-defunct 125\u00a0cc, 250\u00a0cc and 500\u00a0cc Grand Prix classes of the FIM World Championship. From 2002 to 2004 they participated in the FIM MotoGP World Championship, and from 1999 to 2002 they participated in the FIM Superbike World Championship. Aprilia has returned to World Superbike since the 2009 season and in MotoGP since the 2012 season. Aprilia also feature in the off-road racing world, with their 450\u00a0cc V-2 motocrosser producing respectable results (including race wins) in both off-road (Motocross) and on-road (Supermoto) categories. Aprilia made their international racing debut in the Motocross World Championship competing in the 125cc class from 1976 until 1981 with a best result being a fifth place in the 1979 season with rider Corrado Maddi.[4] The firm then focused on the Grand Prix road racing world championships in 1985 and since then it has seen varying successes. Aprilia won their first world championship race at the 1991 Czechoslovak motorcycle Grand Prix with rider Alessandro Gramigni winning the 125cc race.[5] In 1992 they won their first road racing world championship with Gramigni winning the 125cc class.[5] They continued to be successful in the smaller displacement categories, winning numerous races and championships in the 125\u00a0cc and 250\u00a0cc Grand Prix classes. However, their 500\u00a0cc Grand Prix bikes failed to attain the same success. They began campaigning in the 500cc class in 1994 with a 250 V twin motor enlarged to 380cc in hopes of using its lighter weight and nimble handling as an advantage against the heavier, V4 engine bikes used by the competition.[5] The bike eventually displaced 430cc and had its best result with a third place by rider Doriano Romboni at the 1997 Dutch TT but, could never overcome power disadvantage during the starting line sprint and was withdrawn at the end of the 1997 season for further development.[5] Their first MotoGP effort, dubbed the RS Cube, was technically advanced but difficult to ride and performed poorly in the championship. The Cube did, however, pioneer many advanced technologies including ride by wire throttle and pneumatic valve actuation systems. Aprilia left the MotoGP class at the end of 2004 and then left the lower classes when two-stroke engines were banned. Aprilia set the record for the most points earned by a manufacturer in a single season from the 125cc class with 410 points in 2007. It was also the highest points earned by a constructor in Grand Prix motorcycle racing's history until 2011 when 420 points were won by the same bikes winning 16 out of 17 races. The company is also notable for choosing somewhat atypical engine configurations. For example, they progressed with development of a V-2 500\u00a0cc Grand Prix bike when other teams were moving to V-4 configurations for what some believed was better and more usable power outputs. Aprilia continued this trend, taking advantage of lighter minimum weights with the introduction of their RS Cube MotoGP bike\u00a0\u2013 featuring three cylinders in an inline triple layout, the bike had the least number of cylinders on the Grand Prix paddock. Aprilia rejoined the MotoGP class in 2012, taking advantage of the newly introduced Claiming Rule Team category that encouraged independent teams with lower budgets to use bikes from manufacturers not officially involved in MotoGP. Aprilia supplied RSV4 SBK-derived bikes under the ART (Aprilia Racing Technology) name to Aspar, Paul Bird Motorsport and Speed Master teams. In both the 2012 and 2013 seasons Aprilia's ART machinery stood out as the best CRT bikes. For 2015 Aprilia returned to the MotoGP world championship with a factory effort under the name Aprilia Racing Team Gresini with an all-new 1000cc V4-engined RS-GP. Aprilia entered the Superbike World Championship in 1999 using a homologation special version of their V-twin road bike RSV Mille. They were third in the riders' championship in 2000 with rider Troy Corser, and third in manufacturers' points and fourth in rider points both in 2001 with Corser and in 2002 with Noriyuki Haga. Aprilia retired from the series at the end of that season. In February 2008, Aprilia debuted a V-4 superbike, the RSV4, for the 2009 Superbike World Championship.[6] Aprilia won its first Superbike world championship in 2010 with Max Biaggi, claiming both the riders and the manufacturers titles. Aprilia debuted in the FIM Supermoto World Championship in 2004 and since then it has won many titles in both S1 and S2 classes. Aprilia models for 2014 are: ",

In 1947 after the war, a group of researchers and entrepreneurs that began to work on two new upholstering materials \u2013 foam rubber and elastic tape made by Pirelli \u2013 presented the technical specifications of the new products to Marco Zanuso, who saw the huge potential of the new materials in interior furnishings. Zanuso initiated an experimental programme of operations that went on until 1950.[1] Between 1951 and 1954, Arflex  produced various models of car seat designed by Carlo Barassi. These could be fitted into the vehicle instead of standard production seats and offered outstanding comfort,thanks to the use of foam rubber and elastic tape. The covers could be removed and the seatbacks were adjustable. Arflex strove to make its contribution to the comfort of those Italians who were beginning to travel just after the war. The most successful of those car seats were the \"MilleMiglia\" and the \"Sedile Lettino\", a seat that could be turned into a makeshift bed. Both were designed for the Fiat Topolino. Marco Zanuso became a symbol of the developing design culture in post-war Italy, a generation of designers whose social commitment was coloured by the ideological heritage of the Modern Movement. And so the collection of Arflex products is first and foremost an overview of the fruitful collaboration of manufacturer and designer.Marco Zanuso (as a designer) and Arflex (as a manufacturer) started out together, the only such case in the history of furnishings in Italy. The number of designers who contributed to the Arflex range increased steadily: Franco Albini, De Carlo, Belgiojoso\u00a0[it], Peressutti, Roger, Carboni, Pulitzer, Menghi, Joe Colombo, Casati, Spadolini\u00a0[it], Tito Agnoli, Marenco, Cini Boeri, Carlo Colombo, Cristof Pilelt, Vincent Van Duysen, Michele De Lucchi, Ettore Sottsass, Marco Piva, Paola Vella and many others.

(pronounced\u00a0[\u02c8d\u0292ord\u0292o ar\u02c8ma\u02d0ni]) is an Italian luxury fashion house founded by Giorgio Armani which designs, manufactures, distributes and retails haute couture, ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, watches, jewelry, accessories, eyewear, cosmetics and home interiors.The brand markets these products under several labels:[2] Giorgio Armani Priv\u00e9, Giorgio Armani, Armani Collezioni, Emporio Armani (including EA7), Armani Jeans, Armani Junior, and Armani Exchange. The brand utilizes the association of the Armani name with high-fashion, benefiting from its prestige in the fashion industry. In 2016, estimated sales of the company were around $2.65 billion.[3] In 2017, Giorgio Armani announced that his company will close two of its fashion labels, Armani Collezioni and Armani Jeans, as part of the restructuring process for his company. While Armani Collezioni will merge back into the \"Giorgio Armani\" line, Armani Jeans will be mixed with the Emporio Armani line due to their similarities in styles and the use of the same brand logo. Giorgio Armani is in collaboration with Emaar Properties, a chain of luxury hotels and resorts in several big cities including Milan, Paris, New York, London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Dubai.[4][5] The company already operates a range of caf\u00e9s worldwide, in addition to a bar and nightclub. Giorgio Armani is a high-end label specializing in men's and women's ready-to-wear, accessories, glasses, cosmetics, and perfumes. It is available only in Giorgio Armani boutiques, specialty clothiers and select high-end department stores. The logo is a curved \"G\" completing a curved \"A\", forming a circle. In 2016, the fashion house stopped using animal fur in all of its collections, citing the availability of \"valid alternatives at our disposition that render the use of cruel practices unnecessary as regards animals.\"[6] According to The Wall Street Journal and other influential sources, in addition to couture line Armani Priv\u00e9, Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani are company's ready-to-wear lines that show at Milan fashion week. In addition, selling at lower prices are Armani Collezioni, Armani Exchange and Armani Jeans.[7] Emporio Armani is the second brand of Armani family, features ready-to-wear and runway collections. Emporio Armani focuses on trends and modern traits. Also, Emporio Armani along with Giorgio Armani are the only two ready-to-wear brands that are mainly designed by Giorgio Armani himself, and has a spotlight at Milan Fashion Week every year while Armani Collezioni, Armani Jeans, and Armani Exchange do not. Emporio Armani is usually only sold in freestanding Emporio Armani boutiques and its official website.[8] David Beckham starred in four Emporio Armani underwear campaigns from Spring/Summer 2008 to Fall/Winter 2009-2010.[9] David Beckham appeared with his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria, in the campaigns twice in 2009.[10] All campaigns were photographed by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.[9] In January 2010, football star Cristiano Ronaldo and Hollywood movie star Megan Fox became the male and female face and body of Emporio Armani. In 2011, Megan Fox was replaced with Rihanna and Ronaldo was replaced by tennis athlete Rafael Nadal.[11] Emporio Armani has teamed up with Reebok to create fashion shoes under the label EA7. In 2019, Emporio Armani released a new series centered around singer, Shawn Mendes. The black-and-white advertisement featured an instrumental version of his song, \"In My Blood\".[12] Emporio Armani has boutiques in Toronto, Oslo, Frankfurt, Amman, Bahrain, Jeddah, Bogot\u00e1, Miami, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Madrid, Chicago, Paris, London, Glasgow, Los Angeles, Houston, Mexico City, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Milan, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, Sydney, Dubai, Dhaka, Lima, Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo, Vienna, New Delhi, and many other cities around the world. Armani Collezioni (formerly Giorgio Armani Le Collezioni) is the diffusion line of Giorgio Armani that retails at a lower price than Giorgio Armani and the haute couture line, Armani Priv\u00e9. The logo is usually displayed black written on a white label, but often varies.  \"Armani\" being larger and \"Collezioni\" underneath it. It provides made-to-measure tailored suits and shirts where every element can be chosen. In addition to being sold in the two freestanding boutiques (which feature the Collezioni line exclusively) in Milan and Paris, Armani Collezioni usually sold in department stores and outlets while Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani only sold in freestanding boutiques. Last year, a sporty line of this label has appeared named \"Armani Collezioni Active\" in the same way as the EA7 line from Emporio Armani line. A|X Armani Exchange was launched in 1991 in the U.S. It retails fashion and lifestyle products and is known for its occasionally provocative ad campaigns. Inspired by street-chic culture and dance music, it is targeted as the more accessible Armani brand. To accelerate development of the nascent line, Giorgio Armani co-established the joint venture company Presidio Holdings Ltd in 2005 alongside Como Holdings, the company owned by the Singaporean tycoon Ong Beng Seng  that, since 1994, has held the production and distribution license for A/X Armani Exchange in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and Asia-Pacific. Initially, the Italian company held 25% of Presidio Holdings, the remaining 75% in the hands of Como Holdings. In 2008, Giorgio Armani acquired an additional 25% stake. In 2014, it acquired the remaining 50% \"ensuring full ownership of the brand, which has 270 stores and over 3,000 employees\", the company said in a statement. Armani Exchange products are available exclusively in 270 stores in 31 countries and on the brand's website. Giorgio Armani also designs products specifically made for babies, toddlers and teenagers up to sixteen years old. Therefore, he came up with a new label called Armani Junior with a separate label within the product line entitled Armani Baby. The Armani Junior brand was introduced in 1979. The sub-label was often criticized in the public eye because Armani occasionally used real fur for the Armani Junior autumn and winter collections. Many people tend to think that it's unreasonable for a large amount of the public to dress small children in high-end, luxury clothing, which families with a regular or even comfortable income cannot afford.[13] The junior line consists of baby clothing and accessories as well as T-shirts, pullovers, suits, smokings, shoes, hats, shirts, belts, bags, underwear and accessories for children and teenagers.[14] This Armani line is often viewed as the direct competitor of the Italian luxury brand Versace's Young Versace. Armani Junior has 167 independent boutiques around the globe, which only sell the sub-label . The label is also sold in other stores by the label including Armani/Casa, Armani Jeans or Emporio Armani. In total, 308 independent and franchise Armani stores sell the Armani Junior and Armani Baby products throughout the whole world.[15] In addition, the label is available in selected department stores everywhere in the world, for example Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Breuninger and Peek & Cloppenburg.[16] The sub-label sold products worth 2600 million Euros and earned about 750 million in 2010. In 2011, it sold products worth about 3100 Euros and earned about 900 Euros. In 2012, the label earned 1100 million Euros, selling products worth 3.6 billion Euros. In 2013, the label gained sales of about 3.55 billion Euros, earning again 1.1 billion Euros that year alone.[17] In May 2014, Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis was named the face of Armani Junior, which makes her the first major child celebrity to be the face of a luxury brand.[18] The Armani label also consists of a furniture and home collection called Armani/Casa.[19] While the Italian word \"casa\" usually means \"house\", its usage here instead means \"at home\".[20] Giorgio Armani launched his interior design collection in 2000 with a flagship store opening in Milan, Italy the same year. When Armani was asked about why he wanted a furniture line, Armani said that he wanted \"people to design their own private home\". \"Designing this furniture and home collection helped me to stimulate my creative and artistic vein\", Armani said. Critics responded very positively to the Armani/Casa label calling the style \"simply elegant, a little retro with Ethno elements\" to it. A lot of critics also liked the fact that there are only a \"few ornaments\" used but with \"artistic detail\" which seem to have a \"tremendous effect on the style and furniture\" itself.[21] Armani collaborates with Rubelli and the Molteni Group to build the home collection.[22] As the Architectural Digest reported in February 2012, that Armani/Casa includes state-of-the-art kitchens, sold under the Armani/Dada name \u2013 a partnership with Molteni Group, as well as luxurious fabrics produced in collaboration with Rubelli.[23] Armani/Roca is yet another partnership, which provides Giorgio Armani with bathroom furniture and accessoires.[24] The sub-label consisting of variegated products[25] is sold in 183 independent Armani stores as well as selected retailers throughout the world.[15] From 2000 on, Armani/Casa is a multi-million Dollar success for the label.[26] Armani/Casa is used in the Armani hotels,[27] equipped John Mayers New York City apartment[28] and decorated the scenes for the 2013 film Paranoia.[29] A confectionery is also under the Armani name.[30][31] The brand was established in 2002.[32] For the creations and collections Armani collaborates with the Italian chocolate manufacturer Venchi.[33] Armani/Dolci sells chocolates, jams, honey, tea, shortbread biscuits, sugar, marrons glaces, fruit jellies and pralines.[34] The brand is mostly part of other Armani stores but has got an independent boutique in Taichung, Taiwan.[35] In total, 152 stores sell the Armani/Dolci'' products.[15] Over the years, Armani created various limited Armani/Dolci products to celebrate special occasions.[36] For example, Armani designed chocolate easter eggs,[37] heart-shaped boxes with red, pink and lilac chocolate truffles for Valentine's Day,[38] as well as a Ramadan collection for the Muslim holiday[39] featuring refined colours of Islamic art and no alcohol.[40] In addition, Armani/Dolci sells special delicate collections for Christmas[41] and its significant anniversaries.[42] The Armani/Dolci brand is well received by both critics and the public.[43] The Giorgio Armani label also has a florist under its name, called Armani/Fiori.[44] The exclusive floral service is active since 2000 in major independent flower boutiques and other Armani stores around the world.[45] The flowers used for the Armani/Fiori arrangements come mostly from the Netherlands. The label uses a large selection of orchids, as well as exotic and tropical flowers alongside more traditional flowers such as hydrangeas, roses and peonies. Each collection is personally designed by Giorgio Armani himself as he wants to transport an \"Asian feel\".[46] In addition, Armani/Fiori offers decorative elements like vases, flowerpots, candles and lanterns.[47] For the collections, Armani uses precious materials like alabaster, black marble, lacquered wood in the shape of cylinders, cubes, and rhomboids.[48] Giorgio Armani also designed special floral arrangements for occasions like Valentine's Day[49] and spring collections.[50] The labels floral arrangements are used in the Armani hotels.[51] Giorgio Armani and Emaar Properties PJSC signed an agreement in 2005 for Emaar Properties PJSC to build and operate at least seven luxury hotels and three vacation resorts under the Armani name. Armani would be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the interior design and style of the hotels. The Armani hotel was opened in Burj Khalifa on April 27, 2010,[52] comprising the bottom 39 floors of the supertall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It has 160 guest rooms and suites, and 144 residences. Giorgio Armani also designed the interiors of the Armani Residences, also within the skyscraper, and its specially designed line of products from the Armani/Casa home furnishings collection and the Armani/Fiori flower arrangements.[53] The \"Burj Khalifa Armani Residences Road Show\" toured Milan, London, Jeddah, Moscow and Delhi. The London event was housed in the Armani Casa Showroom in New Bond Street.[54] ",

The company's mission is to encourage the dissemination of culture and ideas, through products, activities and services aimed at satisfying the needs and tastes of the broadest possible range of people, bringing together a love of culture and editorial quality with a capacity to identify and anticipate changes in the world of media and communications. The company was founded in 1907[2] in Ostiglia by 18-year-old Arnoldo Mondadori\u00a0[it] who began his publishing career with the publication of the magazine Luce!. In 1912 he founded La Sociale and published the first book AiaMadama together with his close friend Tommaso Monicelli and the following year, La Lampada, a series of children's books.[3] The publishing house kept working intensely even during the First World War, mainly on the publication of magazines for the troops on the front such as La Tradotta, which included contributions from famous illustrators and writers such as Soffici, De Chirico and Carr\u00e0.[4] In 1919 the publishing house headquarters were transferred to Milan. After the First World War, Mondadori launched several successful book series including Gialli Mondadori in 1929, the first example of an Italian book series dedicated to detective and crime novels,[5] by international writers, a new genre for Italy. The series is distinguished by the yellow (giallo in Italian) color of the covers. The response from the public was positive, with five thousand copies sold in a month and eight thousand after a hundred days. In addition to those who are considered the masters of the genre, such as Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Georges Simenon, Agatha Christie and Erle Stanley Gardner, in 1931 even some Italian writers began to take an interest in the genre and write yellow novels. As a result of the success and longevity of the series, still on newsstands, \"giallo\" has become the Italian name of the literary genre. Despite a period of cultural autarky, in 1933 Mondadori started publishing works of international writers with the Medusa book series.[6] In 1935, through an agreement with Walt Disney, the publishing house began the publication of a children's series based on Disney cartoon characters, which ran until 1988, when the agreement between Mondadori and the Walt Disney Company ended.[7] In 1950 Mondadori returned to the information magazines, abandoned ten years earlier with the suspension, due to the war, of the monthly Tempo. The weekly Epoca was born, which imported the American model of photojournalism into Italy. A few years later, in 1962, Mondadori published Panorama. The magazine was born as a monthly information magazine and it was only in 1967 that it became a weekly, inspired by the editorial formula of Time and Newsweek, and was transformed into a successful newsmagazine. In 1952 Mondadori launched I romanzi di Urania (Urania\u2019s novels), a twice monthly Italian science fiction magazine that contributed to the wider diffusion of this genre in Italy.[8] In 1960 Mondadori launched Il Club degli Editori, the first Italian mail-order book club[9] and in 1965 became the first Italian publishing house to launch low-cost paperbacks for sale through newsstands (Oscar Mondadori),[10] an experiment that will be a huge success and that will be imitated by many publishers. The aim of the series was to reach an audience not used to buying in bookshops. The first novel published was A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway, who immediately experienced great results in terms of copies sold. Between 1950 and 1965, the number of employees at Mondadori rose from 335 to 3,000 and resulted in the company\u2019s decision to construct a new building in the outskirts of Milan, specifically within the municipality of Segrate. In 1968, Giorgio Mondadori, Arnoldo\u2019s son and chairman of the publishing house, decides to assign the project for the new headquarters to Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, after having admired his work on the Foreign Ministry (Pal\u00e1cio Itamaraty) in Brasilia three years earlier. The project for the new headquarters is a sort of \u201carchitectural advert\u201d, to quote Niemeyer, a building that does not require signs but is impressed into people\u2019s memory. Construction began in 1971 and the new headquarters was inaugurated in January 1975. Through a joint venture with Gruppo Editoriale L\u2019Espresso in 1976, Mondadori published La Repubblica, its first daily newspaper; Gruppo Editoriale L\u2019Espresso was finally separated from Mondadori in 1991. In 1981 Mondadori entered the television business with the launch of the Rete Quattro TV station, which was sold to Fininvest a few years later. In the same year, through a joint venture with Canada\u2019s Harlequin Enterprises, the romantic fiction book series Harmony began to be published in Italy.[11] The company has been controlled by Fininvest, Silvio Berlusconi's family holding company since 1991.[2] Marina Berlusconi is the chairman.[12] In 1989, Mondadori expanded into Mexico by acquiring Editorial Grijalbo. Beginning in 2001, Mondadori operated a joint venture with Random House in Spanish-speaking countries. Random House bought out Mondadori's stake in 2012.[13] In 2006, Mondadori takes a big step forward in its international expansion with the acquisition of Emap France, one of France\u2019s leading magazine publishers, today Mondadori France.[14] Mondadori is one of the first Italian publishers to enter the e-book market and in 2000 an agreement was signed with Microsoft Corporation for the creation of the first Italian site for the sale of electronic books. In 2010 Mondadori accelerates its presence: in June, the Group\u2019s online bookstore launches a store dedicated to digital books, with a vast catalogue of titles in Italian and English. In December, Mondadori reaches an agreement for the international distribution of books produced by the Group\u2019s publishing houses on Google Books and Google eBooks.[15] Thanks to an accord with Vodafone Italia, in 2011 Mondadori launches the first online newsstand for tablets. Through this new platform it is possible to access the digital edition of the Group\u2019s major weeklies and monthlies. The digital development continues in July 2011 with an agreement between Mondadori and Amazon that makes the Group\u2019s e-books available through the Kindle store. In September 2011, Mondadori\u2019s digital titles are also made available on the iBookstore for the Apple iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. The following year Mondadori Group and Kobo Inc., a leading company globally in digital reading, sign an accord for the distribution in Italy of Kobo\u2019s eReading platform and related devices.[16] In 2014 Mondadori bought the trademark and assets of aNobii, the global social reading platform with more than a million users around the world, of which around 300,000 in Italy, with the aim of supporting the process of growth in digital for books.[17] In 2012 Mondadori publishes Fifty Shades of Grey, the first volume of the erotic trilogy by debut London author E L James, rapidly followed by the two other titles, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. The trilogy sees in Italy the same kind of unprecedented success it gained in the English-language world: with more than 3.3 million copies sold in Italy and 130,000 downloads of the electronic version, the three volumes reach first, third and fourth position of the bestseller list for 2012. In 2015\u201316, the acquisitions of RCS Libri[18] (was renamed to Rizzoli Libri) from RCS MediaGroup as well as Banzai Media[19] mark the culmination of the strategy launched in 2013 of focusing on the traditional core businesses: books and magazines. In 2016, the Italian Competition Authority ruled that Mondadori would have to divest the publishers Bompiani and Marsilio Editori, following its acquisition of RCS Libri.[20][21] Marsilio Editori was sold by Rizzoli Libri to De Michelis family's GEM S.r.l.[22] while Bompiani was sold to Giunti Editore for \u20ac16.5 million.[23] As part of the strategy of focusing on its core businesses, in 2018 the Group sold Panorama[24] and in 2019 its subsidiary Mondadori France.[25] Between 1989 and 1991, there has been a financial conflict between Silvio Berlusconi and Carlo De Benedetti, two of the largest employers of those years. In 1988 Berlusconi bought Leonardo Mondadori's (nephew of Arnoldo Mondadori) shares. Mondadori was then owned by three: Berlusconi's Fininvest, Carlo De Benedetti's CIR and the Formenton family (Arnoldo Mondadori's heir). Carlo De Benedetti convinced the Formentons to conclude an agreement that would bring him to obtain the Formenton's shares by 30 January 1991, but in November 1989 the Formenton family sided with Berlusconi, allowing him to become the new Mondadori chairman on 25 January 1990; De Benedetti then protested, citing on its agreement. The three sides took the unanimous decision of an arbitrary award to solve the conflict. On 20 June 1990 was the first verdict: the agreement between De Benedetti and Formenton was considered still valid; as a consequence, the Mondadori shares became owned by the CIR (De Benedetti) and Berlusconi left the chairmanship of the company. Berlusconi and the Formentons then appealed at the Appeal Court of Rome, which assigned the case to Civil Section I. This section was chaired by Arnaldo Valente and the Judge-Rapporteur was Vittorio Metta. The ruling was made public on 24 January 1991 and nullified the arbitrary award verdict and gave the Mondadori shares back to Berlusconi's Fininvest. In 1995, after receiving some proclamations, the judiciary started investigating the authenticity of the ruling. It turned out that Berlusconi won thanks to the corruption of Judge Vittorio Metta. Metta was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003, but won an appeal in 2005. The Supreme Court of Cassation nullified that appeal in 2006, and Vittorio Metta was sentenced to 1 year and 9 months in 2007. Berlusconi has not been sentenced. The trial expired for time limit.

Under the name of Imperial Regia Privilegiata Compagnia di Assicurazioni Generali Austro-Italiche, the company was founded on December 26, 1831. At the time, Trieste was the most important sea port of the Austrian Empire. The company grew in importance, becoming one of the largest insurance operators both in Italy and in Central Europe. As of 2017[update], the company ranks 57th on the Fortune Global 500 list of companies and 43rd on MITs worldwide \"Smartest Companies\" ranking in 2015.[4] Generali\u2019s major competitors at international level are AXA, Allianz and Zurich. Besides them, there are companies competing at local and regional level in various countries and markets. Today Generali operates primarily in Europe, Middle East and East Asia, with large market shares in Italy, Poland,[6] Hungary, Germany (under the name of Generali Deutschland), France, Austria, Slovenia,[7] The Netherlands, Croatia, Serbia (Generali Osiguranje), Spain, Switzerland, Romania, Israel, Japan, China and Bosnia and Herzegovina, with secondary operations in Latin America. Generali's United States operations are concentrated in financial products management, a result of the group's acquisition of Business Men's Assurance Company of America (BMA) in 1990 and travel insurance products as part of the Europ Assistance Group.[8] In 2002, Generali sold BMA's life insurance arm to the Royal Bank of Canada.[9] In 2013, Generali sold its US reinsurance arm to Scor.[10] On Jerusalem's Jaffa Road, the Generali Building (\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d2'\u05e0\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9), built by the company in 1935, is still known by that name although the company operated its Jerusalem branch in the building only from 1935 to 1946.[11] The Generali Building is still owned by the Italian insurance firm through its local representative, the Migdal Insurance Company.[12] The building currently houses various government offices, including the Jerusalem District Administration, the Ministry of Interior, the Department of Immigration and Population Registry, and the Internal Auditing Office.[11] It is a famous Jerusalem landmark, due to the large and well-preserved stone statue of a winged lion on its roof; this is the Lion of Saint Mark, patron saint of Venice, and the symbol of the Generali insurance company[11][13] which appears on all of its branches worldwide since 1848.[12] In India the company is represented by Future Generali, a joint venture of Future group and Assicurazioni Generali. It provides both life and property/casualty insurance. The Life business is known as Future Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited.[14] Main Subsidiaries of the group includes, in Italy: Genertellife, Alleanza Assicurazioni, Generali Italia and Banca Generali. In France: Europ Assistance Assicurazioni Generali was an active owner of Italian banks, such as Banca Intesa (7.54% direct and indirect ownership[15]) and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (8.71980% in 2004[16]) as minority owner. Both banks are no longer held by Generali Group. Banca Generali is the subsidiary of Assicurazioni Generali. As of June 2016, Assicurazioni Generali's largest shareholders were:[17] Generali is the sponsor of France National Volleyball Team. Generali sponsor of the French Federation of Volleyball for 19 years, launched the Responsible Sports Charter in 2010, coherently with the Group guidelines, to actively promote the culture of sustainability in the sporting arena. After nearly 10 years of struggling to get a big Italian insurance company to pay claims on life insurance policies sold to victims of the Holocaust, the lawyers for most of the victims are giving up the fight. Sidney Zabludoff, a Holocaust insurance expert, estimates that Generali had coverage on about 110,000 Jews at the time, and he estimates this be worth $4.5 billion today. In court papers, Generali says it has paid $135 million on about 5,200 claims.[18] Blood Money - Law & Order Episode is based on Generali subsidiaries selling life insurance to poor Jews in WW2 Europe and then not paying out in case of death. The motive in the murder of a retired insurance salesman appears to be a series of policies he sold to Jews in Poland during the Holocaust.[19] ",

            "text": "Autobianchi (Italian:\u00a0[auto\u02c8bja\u014bki]) was an Italian automobile manufacturer, created jointly by Bianchi, Pirelli and Fiat in 1955. Autobianchi produced only a handful of models during its lifetime, which were almost exclusively small cars, with the biggest being the short-lived Autobianchi A111, a small family car. Autobianchis were priced higher than Fiat models of similar size and the brand was used by Fiat to test new and innovative concepts which later found their way into mainstream Fiat vehicles; these concepts included fibreglass bodies and front-wheel drive. The most famous Autobianchi models include the A112 released in 1969, a small hatchback very popular in Italy for racing, and which ceased production in 1986; as well as the Y10, which was the first car to use Fiat's new FIRE (Fully Integrated Robotised Engine). The Primula was the car with which Fiat introduced the particular front-wheel drive arrangement of engine, transmission and differential (final drive) that has become prevalent in its cars today. Autobianchi was bought by the Fiat group and integrated into the operations of Lancia. The marque survived in Italy until the end of the Y10's production in 1995, but became extinct elsewhere when the model was rebranded as a Lancia in 1989. Bianchi, founded by Edoardo Bianchi in 1885 and now remembered primarily as a bicycle manufacturer, was also active in passenger car manufacturer from 1899. Bianchis were in general high-end luxury cars, made with high attention to detail. The company's factory in Abruzzi was destroyed by bombing during World War II. Edoardo Bianchi himself died in 1946 in a car accident, and the ownership of the firm passed to his son, Giuseppe. Even though a new, modern facility was constructed in Desio after the war, economic conditions forced Giuseppe not to resume passenger car production, but rather to focus on bicycles, motorcycles and commercial vehicles.[1][2][3] Bianchi bicycles are still manufactured. Bianchi's general manager, Ferruccio Quintavalle, wanted to take advantage of the company's extensive experience in manufacturing cars and ordered the preparation of studies and prototypes of possible new models. Soon it became apparent that resuming passenger car production would not be feasible without a help of stronger partner. Therefore, Bianchi turned to large industrial groups Fiat and Pirelli with a proposal to form a new company to produce automobiles. Thus, the Autobianchi company was born, with the agreement signed by the three parties on 11 January 1955 and share capital of 3 million lira, 33% of which belonged to the Bianchi family. A new, modern, purpose-built plant for the production of Autobianchi cars was erected on an area of 140,000 square metres in Desio.[2][3] Each of the partners had a clearly defined role and interest in the venture. Fiat was to provide the technical base and components for the assembly of the cars. It was seeking to capture the premium niche of the small car market, at that time occupied by coachbuilders such as Moretti and Vignale, who were building their models on Fiat chassis. Pirelli, which was to supply tires for the cars, sought to expand their OEM market share. Bianchi, was assigned the duties of preparing the bodies and assembling complete vehicles; a step towards their desired return to full passenger car production.[2][3] The first car to be produced by the new company was the Bianchina, whose name was a tribute to Edoardo Bianchi's first 1899 car. The Bianchina was based on Fiat 500 mechanicals \u2013 with its two-cylinder, air-cooled engine mounted in the rear \u2013 but featured a completely new stylish body designed by Luigi Rapi, who was in charge of Fiat's special body unit and helped to set up production in Desio. With many premium design and equipment features, the Bianchina was an upscale city car, positioned above the Fiat 500 in the market. Marketed as a \"second vehicle in the household\", and a luxurious \"recreational vehicle\", also being targeted at affluent middle-class women, it mirrored the increasing affluence in Italian society.[2][3][4][5] The first Bianchina rolled from the production lines in Desio on September 11, 1957 and had the unusual body style of a two-door landaulet, called \"Trasformabile\". It remained the sole body style until 1960, when a two-door \"Cabriolet\" full convertible was introduced, followed by a three-door estate version, the \"Panoramica\" and a two-door saloon, the \"Berlina\". Finally, two van versions were launched: one resembling a two-seater version of the Panoramica, and another, with a raised and expanded cargo section.[2][3][4][5] Five years after the debut of the Bianchina, at the 1963 Turin Motor Show, a completely new Autobianchi model debuted: the Autobianchi Stellina. A two-door spider based on the Fiat 600D's chassis was distinguished by its fibreglass body, designed by Tom Tjaarda. It was Italy's first car with such a body. The vehicle was only produced for two years (1964 and 1965) and only 502 Stellinas were made. Nevertheless, the model was an important step in the development of new technology for Fiat and the rest of the automotive industry. Its lofty price-tag of almost a million lira further emphasized the elevated status of the Autobianchi brand within the Fiat empire. Even more important was the following year's presentation, the Autobianchi Primula. It was Fiat's first attempt at a front-wheel drive car with a transverse engine, a configuration popularized by the British Mini and allowing for very compact and efficient utilization of the body space. Designed by Fiat's technical director, Dante Giacosa, it was launched under the Autobianchi brand to test market reaction to the new concept. The Primula's particular configuration of front wheel drive with a transverse engine,  but with a gearbox on the end of the engine and unequal length drive shafts, rather than a gearbox in the sump like the Mini, became universal; as did its use of conventional steel suspension in almost all other cars with the exception of Citroen- usually MacPherson struts at the front and a \"dead\" rear axle. Indeed, Peugeot in facelifting their 305 range on the early 1980s switched from their former adherence to the Mini in-sump gearbox to the Primula's end-on gearbox configuration. The Primula is thus a car design of far greater significance than is often realised, as its design influence spread far beyond even the mainstream high volume Fiats such as the 127 and the 128 of the late 1960s. Even though the new Autobianchi was priced higher than Fiat models of similar size, the car met with a favorable reception. Fiat would gradually move all of its models to front-wheel drive. Throughout its production run the Primula was available as a two-door or five-door saloon, three-door of five-door hatchback, and two-door coup\u00e9, with either a 1,221\u00a0cc or a 1,197\u00a0cc four-cylinder engine. The top of the line Primula Coup\u00e9 S used a 75\u00a0PS (SAE) 1,438\u00a0cc four-cylinder from the Fiat 124 Special. The lack of a fifth gear limited the high-end capacity of all Primula models.[6] Facing a crisis in the motorcycle market, Bianchi was forced to sell its share in Autobianchi and the company was finally fully integrated into Fiat S.p.A. in 1968. 1969 marked many important developments for the marque. First of all, Bianchina production was finally stopped. Moreover, Autobianchi was positioned within the Fiat Group under the control of the newly acquired luxury marque Lancia. And significantly, two new Autobianchi models were launched this year: the Autobianchi A111 and Autobianchi A112,[2][3][4][7] both named after their internal Fiat development codes, in a similar fashion to coeval Fiat-branded vehicles.[8] The A111 was derived from Primula mechanicals, but much bigger and more spacious, marking the first (and only) entry of the brand into the small family car class. As usual, it was priced higher than similar Fiat models, notably the first front-wheel drive Fiat per se, the Fiat 128, and did not much find much favour with customers. After little more than 50,000 A111s were made, production ended in 1972. The A112 was much more successful. A modern, front-wheel drive supermini it was in many ways similar to the Innocenti Mini, which gained substantial popularity in Italy, following on from the popularity of the original Mini throughout Europe. Similarly, the A112 saw strong demand and built a loyal following, reinforced by the introduction of Abarth sporting versions and Autobianchi's engagement in racing with modified versions of the model. With Primula production ceasing in 1970 and the quick demise of the A111, Autobianchi became effectively a one-model brand. Consequently, the A112 was marketed as a Lancia from the mid-1970s in most markets, except for Italy, France and Israel, where it retained the Autobianchi branding until the end of production. The A112 continued in production for 17 years, with frequent, often substantial, changes. After production over 1,250,000, the A112 was replaced in 1986 by the Autobianchi Y10, based mechanically on the Fiat Panda. Branded as a Lancia for most export markets (except for France and Israel, until 1989), it retained Autobianchi badging and branding in Italy. The Desio plant closed in 1992 and the Y10 replaced by the Lancia Y (branded as Lancia in all markets including Italy), the Autobianchi brand ended  in 1996. The rights to the brand are now held by the Registro Autobianchi, the official club of the marque in Italy.[3] ",

Pavesi had begun to operate a service area on the Milan-Novara motorway in 1947, replacing it with a bridge-restaurant accessible by travellers in both directions fifteen years later.[8] Having grown both domestically and through foreign acquisitions, Autogrill was privatised by the Italian Government in 1995 as IRI shed its food and beverage businesses.[8] Edizione Holding, the financial holding company of the Benetton family, acquired a controlling stake through the process. Edizione floated the company on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1997, sparking a series of acquisitions in overseas markets: by the end of 1998, Autogrill had secured full control of French operator Sogerba (previously owned by Granada Group);[9] AC Restaurants and Hotels of Benelux[10] as well as 14 branches of the Wienerwald chain in Austria and Germany.[11] In July 1999 the group made its first entry into both the United States and airport concession markets[8] by acquiring Host Marriott Services, which was then renamed HMSHost.[12] Other major acquisitions by the group included the Swiss firm Passaggio (completed in 2001),[8] 70% of high-speed train station operator Receco in 2002,[13] Spanish-based airport duty-free retailer Aldeasa in 2005 (50-50 with Altadis)[14] and Belgium's Carestel (completed in 2007).[15] Autogrill acquired the remaining 50% in Aldeasa for complete control in 2008. It also purchased Alpha Group [16] and World Duty Free Europe in 2008 and merged them with Aldeasa in 2011 to create World Duty Free Group, a super-retailer at Airports.[17] In 2010, it had \u20ac785 million in sales in the United Kingdom and \u20ac494 million in sales in Spain.[5] On 6 June 2013, Autogrill approved the project of proportional partial demerger whereby Autogrill S.p.A. transferred the Travel Retail and Duty Free business to its wholly owned subsidiary World Duty Free S.p.A. (parent company of World Duty Free Group), the beneficiary, by assigning to the latter the entire shareholding in the Group\u2019s Travel Retail and Duty Free business.[18] On 1 October 2013, World Duty Free has listed on the Borsa Italia in Milan, marking the culmination of the demerger process from parent group Autogrill.[18] ",

Banca Carige and its subsidiaries are known as Banca Carige Group (Italian: Gruppo Banca Carige). The banking group, as of 1 April 2018, is one of the larger banking groups that were supervised by the European Central Bank.[2] As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02017[update], the banking group had 529 branches[1]:11 throughout Italy, with one branch in Nice, France.[1]:30 About 37.2% branches are located in the home region Liguria.[1]:30 In 1483 the Franciscan religious Angelo Da Chivasso, founded the mount of piety (Italian: Monte di Piet\u00e0) of Genoa.[3][non-primary source needed] In 1846, a decree of Piedmont-Sardinia King Charles Albert of Sardinia created the Cassa di Risparmio di Genova,[3][non-primary source needed] which extended the basic financial services of the mount to encourage and protect small savings more widely.[citation needed] In the 19th century, the bank expanded into western Liguria, and in 1967 it became the Cassa di Risparmio di Genova e Imperia.[3][non-primary source needed] Imperia was the capital of the west most province of Liguria region. In 1991, due to Amato Law, the bank, as a statutory corporation, was split into Banca Carige S.p.A. and Fondazione Carige,[4] forming Gruppo Banca Carige in the same year. The bank absorbed Istituto di Credito Fondiario della Liguria and Mediocredito Ligure. In January 1995 Banca Carige entered into the Borsa Italiana as a listed company. In 1997 the Gruppo Banca Carige acquired some insurance companies. In 2000 Carige Vita Nuova Assicurazioni was created from Basilese Vita Nuova, while in 2002 Carige Assicurazioni was founded from Levante Norditalia. In 2000 the Banca Carige Group acquired the Cassa di Risparmio di Savona and the Banca del Monte di Lucca. Between 2000 and 2002, Carige completed three further acquisitions of branches from other banks: 21 branches from Banco di Sicilia, 61 from Banca Intesa group, and 42 from the Capitalia Group in Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia\u2013Romagna, Tuscany, Lazio, Marche, Umbria, Apulia, and Sicily. In 2004 the bank strengthened its position in Tuscany with the acquisition of the Cassa di Risparmio di Carrara and founded  Carige Asset Management SGR for the management of financial products. In 2004 the bank acquired the private bank Banca Cesare Ponti. In 2008, two further major acquisitions were completed: 79 branches from the Intesa Sanpaolo Group in Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, and Sardinia, and another 38 branches from the UniCredit Group in Lazio, Sicily, Emilia\u2013Romagna, Veneto, and Umbria.[5] In 2010 the bank acquired another 22 branches from Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena.[3][non-primary source needed] In September 2013, the Bank of Italy (Italian central bank) blamed Carige for using accountancy tricks and being in a difficult situation due to derivatives the bank had bought from Deutsche Bank. Carige published a statement to explain the event.[6] The Bank of Italy demands from Carige a new business plan by the end of October.[7] In 2013 the bank sold its asset management subsidiary to ARCA SGR for \u20ac101\u00a0million.[8] In 2014 the bank sold its insurance subsidiaries Carige Assicurazioni and Carige Vita Nuova to investment funds managed by Apollo Global Management for \u20ac310 million (via Primavera Holdings S.r.l.).[9][10] However, in 2016 the new board of directors want to sue the old managers for mismanagement by selling the insurance companies, claiming it actually harmful to the bank instead of gain.[11] However, the court rejected the lawsuit.[12] In mid-2015, subsidiaries Cassa di Risparmio di Savona (with second-tier subsidiary Immobiliare Carisa), Cassa di Risparmio di Carrara, Columbus Carige Immobiliare were absorbed into Banca Carige.[13] In 2016 Banca Carige Italia was absorbed by Banca Carige. Circa 2015, Malacalza Investimenti replaced Fondazione Carige, as the largest shareholder of the bank. The Banca Carige Chairman Giuseppe Tesauro resigned on 26 June 2018.[14][15] Vittorio Malacalza, representing the majority shareholder of the bank: Malacalza Investimenti, also resigned as a director in July.[16][17] In total, 8 directors, or the majority of the board excluding CEO Paolo Fiorentino, had resigned in mid-2018.[18][19][20][21][22] However, in the re-election of the whole board, Malacalza Investimenti, secured a majority of the new board for 7 seats, as well as hiring Fabio Innocenzi as new CEO.[23] In September 2018, Carige also followed the peer to sell their merchant acquiring business to Nexi.[24] In November 2018, the bank was bailed-out by the voluntary arm of the Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi (FITD). The voluntary arm of FITD was funded by some of the Italian banks,[25] which partially underwritten (\u20ac318.2\u00a0million, plus 1.8\u00a0million[26] from non-member of the voluntary arm: Banco di Desio e della Brianza[27]) the issue of the Tier 2 subordinated bonds of Carige of a size of \u20ac400\u00a0million in order to boost its capital.[28][26] On 2 January 2019 European Central Bank appointed administrators including former Chairman Pietro Modiano and CEO Fabio Innocenzi (who resigned in December 2018), to run the bank after they were unable to raise \u20ac400\u00a0million of new share capital at the end of 2018.[29] The board of directors, controlled by Malacalza Investimenti, rejected the proposed capital increase in December 2018.[30] It was reported that BlackRock once interested in acquiring the bank, but withdrew from the negotiation in May 2019.[31] Another bid from Apollo Global Management, however, was rejected by FITD.[32] As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02017[update], the Gruppo Banca Carige is a financial group composed by the Banca del Monte di Lucca,[1] Banca Cesare Ponti[1] and Creditis Servizi Finanziari[1] and other subsidiaries.[1] According to CONSOB data, the main shareholders of Gruppo Banca Carige on 4 October 2018 are:[33] The former Banca Carige Chairman Giovanni Berneschi had been condemned for 8 years of imprisonment by Italian Court in July 2018, due to a fraud that related to the bank.[35] ",

(Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8ba\u014bka \u02c8monte dei \u02c8paski di \u02c8sj\u025b\u02d0na]), known as BMPS or just MPS, is an Italian bank. Tracing its history to a mount of piety founded in 1472 (547 years ago) and founded in its present form in 1624 (395 years ago), it is the world's oldest or second oldest bank, depending on the definition, and the fourth largest Italian commercial and retail bank.[3] In 1995 the bank, then known as Monte dei Paschi di Siena, was transformed from a statutory corporation to a limited company called Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (Banca MPS). The Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena was created to continue the charitable functions of the bank and to be, until the bailout in 2013, its largest single shareholder. Today Banca MPS has approximately 2,000 branches, 26,000 employees and 5.1 million customers[2] in Italy, as well as branches and businesses abroad. A subsidiary, MPS Capital Services, handles corporate and investment banking.[4] According to a research by Mediobanca and a press release by Banco BPM, Banco BPM overtook BMPS as the third largest commercial banking group in Italy in terms of total assets on 31 December 2016, after Banco BPM's formal formation on 1 January 2017.[5][6] In 2016\u201317, BMPS was struggling to avoid a collapse,[7][8] and was bailed out again by the Italian government in July 2017. On 5 October, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced the sale of its Belgian subsidiary, Banca Monte Paschi Belgio (BMPB) to a company participated by funds managed by Warburg Pincus. The sale price was set at \u20ac42 million, subject to an adjustment mechanism. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena traces its history to a mount of piety (monte di piet\u00e0) founded by order of the Magistrature of the Republic of Siena on 4 March 1472, when its statute was approved. It is therefore often regarded as being the oldest bank in the world in continuous operation. The basis of its foundation is the Statuto dei Paschi, written in 1419, a law that regulated all activities related to agriculture and pastoralism in Maremma. Its current form dates from 1624, when Siena was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and Grand Duke Ferdinando II granted to depositors of Monte, in their warranty, the income of the state-owned pastures of Maremma (the so-called \"Paschi\" which gave the bank its name). The bank consolidated and increased its banking activity during the 17th and 18th centuries. With the unification of Italy, the bank expanded its business throughout the Italian peninsula, initiating new activities, including mortgage loans, the first experience in Italy. MPS was also involved in the bail-out of Cassa di Risparmio di Prato, becoming the major shareholder. In 1995, a decree of the Ministry of the Treasury of the Italian Republic dated 8 August 1995, gave rise to two institutions: Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena S.p.A. and Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena,[9] a non-profit organization with the statutory purpose of providing assistance, charity and social utility in the fields of education, science, health and art, especially with reference to the city and the province of Siena. On 25 June 1999, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena was listed successfully on the Italian Stock Exchange. After its debut on the Italian Stock Exchange, the bank began an intense phase of commercial and operational expansion. The bank acquired some regional banks: Banca Agricola Mantovana and Banca del Salento, while subsidiary Banca Toscana was absorbed. In 2003, the controlling interests (79%) of Cassa di Risparmio di Prato was sold to Banca Popolare di Vicenza in March 2003 for \u20ac411.2 million.[10] The bank had also started a process to reinforce the structures of production in strategic market segments through the development of product companies: At the same time, the bank upgraded its commercial productivity, with the aim of improving the level of assistance and consultancy to investors and businesses, and updated its activities in private banking and in private pension plans. At the conclusion of this plan of expansion, the bank implemented a vast program of opening new branches of the Group, with more than 2,000 branches. In order to finance this expansion model, the bank entered into some derivatives that were hidden: operations Santorini in 2002 and Alexandria in 2006.[11] On 8 November 2007, Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced that it had reached an agreement with Banco Santander to buy Banca Antonveneta for \u20ac9 billion[12][13] excluding the subsidiary Interbanca that is owned by the Spanish bank. Antonveneta is the bank that after the Bancopoli scandal was acquired by ABN AMRO and was supposed to go to Banco Santander after the purchase of the Dutch bank by the consortium of RBS, Santander, Fortis. From February 2007 to June 2008 Banca MPS sold all the shares (27.839%) in Finsoe, an intermediate holding company of Unipol Group, for \u20ac584.8 million.[14][15] In 2008, Quadrifoglio Vita, a joint venture insurance company of Unipol and Banca Agricola Mantovana, was acquired by AXA from Unipol via Banca MPS,[15] Banca Agricola Mantovana was also absorbed into Banca MPS. Banca MPS also acquired regional bank Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli from Intesa Sanpaolo in December 2007 for about \u20ac399 million.[16] In the wake of rising yields and declining valuations on Italian government debt in the European sovereign-debt crisis, MPS lost over $2 billion in the first half of 2012, had to recapitalize, and faced restructuring or worse. The majority owner until the recapitalization, the Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena, long resisted issuing new capital which would dilute its holding. In September 2012, even after the dilution, the bank \"appear[ed] poised\" also to give the national government a greater ownership stake in return for more capital.[17] In December 2012, Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli was sold to Cassa di Risparmio di Asti for about \u20ac205.5 million.[18][19] In 2009, the Santorini and Alessandria operations began creating huge losses. In order to hide them in the bank's financial statements, the top management, including Giuseppe Mussari, the bank president, chose to enter into derivative contracts with Deutsche Bank and Nomura. Estimates of the losses accumulated by the Santorini and Alessandria operations in the period leading up to the derivative contracts range from \u20ac500 to \u20ac750 million.[20] The documentation concerning these operations was never communicated to the bank's own auditors or the Banca d'Italia. The derivative contracts and related documentation were discovered and made public by the new board of the bank at the end of November 2012. The documentation was then forwarded to the Banca d'Italia between December 2012 and mid-January 2013. The shareholders and the analysts have ascertained that the bank had not declared losses from derivatives. On 22 January 2013, the bank's shares lost 5.6% on the stock exchange and Mussari resigned as president of Associazione Bancaria Italiana.[13] On 23 January 2013, the scandal of the hidden derivatives was revealed. The bank's shares dropped 8.43% on the stock exchange that day,[21] and another 8% the next day.[22] On 25 January 2013, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the bank was convened. They resolved to grant the Board of Directors the power to increase the share capital by a maximum amount of \u20ac4.5 billion to service the exercise of conversion rights of the bank of the Monti bonds. MPS called for an intervention of \u20ac3.9 billion, including \u20ac1.9 billion for the replacement of the previous Tremonti bonds. The delegation of the extraordinary powers to the Board of Directors has also included the possibility of increasing the share capital of \u20ac2 billion at the exclusive service of the payment of interest payable in shares. The shareholders approved with a 98% vote in favour.[23] After the vote, the bank recovered 11.36% on the stock exchange after having lost more than 20% of its value in three sessions in three days.[24] On 26 January 2013 the Banca d'Italia (Bank of Italy) approved a bailout request from the bank for \u20ac3.9 billion ($5.3 billion).[25] The firm sparked fresh controversy in 2013 when it was accused of misleading Italy's market regulator in October 2012, shortly before it received a 4.1-billion euro ($5.47 billion) state bailout.[26] On 29 December 2013, Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena rejected plans for issuing \u20ac3 billion worth of new shares, delaying the raising of capital until at least May 2014 and increasing the risk of nationalization.[27] In March 2014, BlackRock declared a 5.748 percent stake in the bank (as the bank was still a constituent of stock market indices at that time, such as the FTSE MIB, fund managers held stakes in their index tracking funds, and were required to disclose stakes of 5% or higher).[28] In July, the capital increase was completed, of which the banking foundation had just owned 2.500% shares. In October, the bank failed the ECB's stress test of major European banks, (first Comprehensive Assessment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) and was given two weeks to prepare a plan to raise \u20ac2.11 billion in capital. Despite issuing \u20ac5 billion in shares just four months earlier, the ECB declared the bank unable to withstand a financial catastrophe. Shares proceeded to drop 22%.[29]  In November, 2014, the bank reported a loss of \u20ac1.1497 billion in the 3rd quarter of the year.[30][31] Eventually in 2014 financial year, the bank had a net loss of \u20ac5.3429 billion, resulting in the capital increase  to be vaporized. The Tier 1 capital ratio of the bank was 8.7% as at 31 December 2014.[32] On 6 July 2015, following the Greek bailout referendum, trading in Monte dei Paschi shares was suspended after they fell 5.7%.[33] Eventually Banca MPS achieved a net profit of \u20ac388 million in 2015. but mainly due to the effect of the restatement as a CDS derivative of the Alexandria transaction. The CET1 capital ratio of the bank was 12%, mainly due to another capital increase during the year, which the European Central Bank required Banca MPS to have a minimum of 10.75% from 31 December 2016 onward, or 10.2% in the transitional period.[34] Moreover, both the gross (34%) and net non-performing loan to total loan ratio (22%) were still higher than the Italian average (18.1% in gross and 10.8% in net at December 2015)[35] and the Italian average itself was higher than the European Union average. On 21 January 2016 MPS securitized \u20ac1.6 billion performing lease receivables portfolio for a value of \u20ac1.4173 billion. The bank repurchased \u20ac656 million of the securities (tranches B to D) and sold \u20ac761.3 million of the securities to the market (tranche A).[36] In April 2016 German Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret commented that many Greek and Italian banks were zombie banks that were kept for political reasons. He urged that European Central Bank should deal with banks with high level of non-performing loans. However, he did not state specifically if BMPS was one of the zombie banks or not.[37] On 23 June a gross value of \u20ac290 million bad loan portfolio was disposed of without recourse to Kruk Group.[38] On 4 July the bank confirmed that a request of reducing non-performing loans from European Central Bank was received. In 2015 the bank had \u20ac46.9 billion NPLs in gross and \u20ac24.2 billion in net. The bank targeted to reduce the gross NPLs to total loans ratio to 20% in 2018. However, this was still higher than the Italian average at 31 December 2015.[39] On 29 July 2016, 2016 European Union bank stress test was announced. Among the 51 banks in the test, BMPS was the only bank that CET1 ratio (in full Basel III basis) was forecast as negative in the adverse scenario in 2018.[40] If setting CET1 Ratio and Total Capital Ratio (fully loaded basis) targets at 8% and 11.5% respectively even in the adverse scenario in 2018, it would mean the bank would have a capital shortfall of \u20ac8.8 billion (core tier 1, additional tier 1 and tier 2 capitals combined),  according to European Central Bank publication on 29 December 2016.[41][42] On the same day, the plan to recapitalize the bank for \u20ac5 billion was announced; the bank also planned to securitize the entire bad loan portfolio for a target of \u20ac9.2 billion, which had a net book value of \u20ac10.2 billion as at 31 March 2016. The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed \u20ac1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for \u20ac1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for \u20ac1.526 billion in December 2016);[43] the senior tranches would be sold to the market with some of them being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for \u20ac6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers.[44] In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine tranche (for \u20ac1.171 billion) was added\u2014to be underwritten by the bank itself.[43] In September 2016, CEO Fabrizio Viola[45] and chairman Massimo Tononi resigned.[46] They were replaced by Marco Morelli[47] and Alessandro Falciai, respectively. On 28 November 2016, every 100 BMPS shares were converted into one (1) new BMPS share[48] and, on 2 December 2016, AXA and BMPS announced a renewal of their partnership bancassurance\u2014an agreement intended to prevail until 2027.[49] In December 2016, BMPS successfully made debt-to-equity swap for part of their subordinated debt and Tier 1 capital instrument, for a maximum price of \u20ac24.9 per new share (on top of \u20ac5 billion new shares issue).[50][51] In mid-December, BMPS reopened the offer for the swap, which reached approx. \u20ac2.451\u00a0billion. However, due to the failure to issue \u20ac5\u00a0billion new shares, the swap offer and disposal of NPLs were voided.[52] Although J.P. Morgan, Mediobanca, Banco Santander, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs had signed a pre-underwriting agreement with BMPS in July.[44] No banks and no anchor investor entered into contracts with BMPS. At 01:20am, on 23 December 2016, the midnight after the failed recapitalisation, BMPS requested a precautionary recapitalisation by the Italian Government in order to bail out the bank by excising Article 32(4) of EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (The EU-wide banking resolution law, which restricted state aid to a mean of last resort).[53] On 20 December the Italian Government had already raised \u20ac20 billion to set up a save-savings (Italian: salva-risparmio) fund[54] in order to subscribe a possible recapitalisation of UniCredit, BMPS, Banca Popolare di Vicenza, Veneto Banca and Banca Carige, as well as banks that need recapitalisation in the near future. It was reported that the subordinate bond would be mandatorily converted to shares by the resolution authority of Italy (which is Bank of Italy) as a \"bail-in\". However, the bank had requested a Tier 2 subordinate capital instrument \"Fresh 2008\" excluded from such bail-in,[53] as many investors were retail investors. On 25 January 2017 BMPS issued bonds with \u20ac7 billion face value. The bonds would mature from 1 to 3 years, with the state guarantee from the aforementioned government fund. The bank said the bond would be sold to the market or used as a collateral in borrowing process.[55] On 3 February 2017 BMPS sold its card business to Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) for \u20ac520\u00a0million.[56] Other leading banks of Italy, such as Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit had already sold their division in 2016. On 9 February 2017 BMPS announced their 2016 financial results subject to the approval of general shareholders' meeting. The bank 2016 revenue, net interest income and pre-provision profit were decreased, compared to 2015. Combined with the write-down and provisions for NPLs, the net loss of the year was \u20ac3.380\u00a0billion. The CET1 ratio was reaching the legal minimal threshold of 8.0% (below ECB requirement in individual basis on the bank for 10.75%)[57] On 1 June 2017 European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager agreed in-principle for the state aid of the bank.[58] On 5 July, the industrial plan of the bank was approved, which the bank would be re-capitalized for \u20ac8.1\u00a0billion, but only \u20ac3.9\u00a0billion would be underwritten by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (excluding additional shares that would be buyback from retail bondholders by the government), with the rest were the \"bail-in\" of bondholders, mandatorily converted the bond of the bank to shares.[59] On 29 July, the bank announced that the issue price of the new shares to the government was \u20ac6.49, with \u20ac8.65 for debt-to-equity shares.[60] Stefania Bariatti replaced her predecessor as chairperson of MPS during December 2017.[61][62] MPS headquarters in the Palazzo Salimbeni in Siena hosts an art collection and a large number of priceless historical documents spanning the centuries of its existence. However, this collection is not usually open to the public. The most recent publicly known acquisition of art, a gold-plated panel by Segna di Bonaventura, cost the bank nearly one million Euro.[63] It is also internationally known as the primary sponsor of Italian basketball club Mens Sana Basket of Siena, currently in Lega A and a regular participant in the Euroleague. In 2010, the bank was funding the expansion of a small airport in the heart of the Tuscan countryside, Siena\u2013Ampugnano Airport, to become an international airport. Both international and local groups had raised objections to this expansion on the grounds it would damage the natural beauty of the area, the environment and the attraction of the countryside to tourism.[64][65] Eventually, Aeroporto di Siena S.p.A., the company incorporated for the project, was liquidated . Until the euro-crisis, profits from the bank financed the Palio di Siena, Siena's historic-building renovations and \"biotech programs\" intended to turn the Tuscan plain into a research hub. Nearly all that money \u2013 $150 million a year, on average, from 1996 to 2010 \u2013 has \"evaporated\" since 2010.[17] According to the annual report of the banking foundation, which acted as both the largest shareholders of the bank and the charity organization for Tuscan area, the foundation suffered a sharp decrease in revenue from the bank in 2009, which dropped from \u20ac340 million to just \u20ac62.5 million, thus affecting the endowment to other organizations.[66] Along with other loss related and not related to the bank since 2010, the foundation had to suspend all the endowment to other organizations.[67][68][69] Main shareholders of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena The share owned by Fondazione Monte dei Paschi di Siena dropped from over 55% on 31 December 2009[71] to below CONSOB requirement to disclose (<2%) in 2015.[72] Coordinates: 43\u00b019\u203216.24\u2033N 11\u00b019\u203250.43\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.3211778\u00b0N 11.3306750\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.3211778; 11.3306750 ",

It was re-privatized and listed on the Milan Stock Exchange in 1998, before being acquired by French banking group BNP Paribas in 2006.  Banca Nazionale del Lavoro began Argentine operations in 1960, ultimately opening 91 branches, before selling its operation there to HSBC Bank Argentina in 2006.[citation needed] The bank was involved in a major political scandal (dubbed Iraqgate by the media) when it was revealed in 1989 that the Atlanta, Georgia branch of the bank was making unauthorized loans of more than US$4.5\u00a0billion to Iraq.  Many of the loans that the branch made were guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation program.  The loans were originally intended to finance agricultural exports to Iraq, but were diverted by Iraq to buy weapons.  The branch manager, Christopher Drogoul, indicated that the bank's headquarters office was aware of these loans, but senior bank official denied this.  Drogoul pleaded guilty to three felony charges and served 33 months in federal prison.[2] At the year end of 2004 the major shareholders with more than 2% were [3] After a short period of Unipol minority ownership as well as the exposed bancopoli scandal, BNP Paribas signed an agreement with 13 shareholders of BNL, representing 48% shares of BNL on 6 February 2006.

Before the merger, BPM was a listed company on the Borsa Italiana (Milan Stock Exchange); after the merger, only the parent company Banco BPM is a listed company. As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02016[update], before the merger, the bank had 656 branches, including private banking and corporate banking centres; about 61% of the branches of BPM were from Lombardy (390); the group also had branches in Emilia-Romagna (28), Lazio (65), Apulia (36), Piedmont (87), Liguria (11), Veneto (7), Tuscany (5), Campania (2), Marche (1), Molise (1), Abruzzo (1) and Friuli\u2013 Venezia Giulia (1).[2] After the merger, As of 31\u00a0December\u00a02017[update], Banca Popolare di Milano, excluding Banca Akros, had 604 branches.[3] The second cooperative bank in Italy (the first one was the Banca Popolare di Lodi), it was founded in 1865[4] in Milan by Luigi Luzzatti, who later served as the nation's Prime Minister.  Luzzatti drew his inspiration from the 'credit associations' developed by Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Germany a decade earlier.[5] BPM has grown considerably since the 1950s by buying interests in other banks such as Banca Popolare di Roma (1924-1957), la Banca Briantea, Banca Agricola Milanese, Banca Popolare Cooperativa Vogherese, Banca Popolare di Bologna e Ferrara, Banca Popolare di Apricena, INA Banca, Cassa di Risparmio di Alessandria, Banca di Legnano and Banca Popolare di Mantova.

The bank merged with Banca Popolare di Milano on 1 January 2017. The bank was ranked fourth by total assets (among retail and commercial bank), according to Ricerche e Studi using 2015 data.[2] The bank was a cooperative partnership. However, Italian Law N\u00b03/2015 required all Popular Banks (Banca Popolare) with total assets above \u20ac8 billion, to transform into societ\u00e0 per azioni (company limited by shares). In 2016 it was announced that the bank would be merged with Banca Popolare di Milano. At the same time the new bank would be registered as S.p.A. Banco Popolare was a component of FTSE MIB index of Borsa Italiana (Italian stock exchange). The group had branches in 19 out of 20 regions of Italy, except in Abruzzo (the subsidiary Banca Caripe was sold in 2011). Moreover, the bank was absent in several provinces of Italy, such as South Tyrol (the equity investment in S\u00fcdtiroler Sparkasse was sold in 2007), and the province of Sondrio, Lombardy. Moreover, the bank only presented in one out of eight provinces of Sardinia and one out of five provinces of Calabria (only in Reggio Calabria). Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara, Societ\u00e0 Cooperativa a responsabilit\u00e0 limitata (known as just Banco Popolare; P.I. 0323127 023 6) was formed in 2002 by the merger of Banco Popolare di Verona \u2013 S.Geminiano e S.Prospero and Banca Popolare di Novara.[3] From 2002 to 2004 the group made multiple deal with insurer Cattolica Assicurazioni on Credito Bergamasco and other joint ventures.[4][5] The partnership with the insurer ended in 2007, which after the merger with BPI, the new banking group changed to partner with Fondiaria-Sai in bancassurance (Popolare Vita, ex-BPV Vita). Banco Popolare Societ\u00e0 Cooperativa (P.I. 0370043 023 8) was formed by the merger of Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara (BPVN) and Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI).[6] After the deal a new holding company was formed, with Banco Popolare di Verona \u2013 S.Geminiano e S.Prospero, Banca Popolare di Novara, Banca Popolare di Lodi, Credito Bergamasco and Cassa di Risparmio di Lucca Pisa Livorno were the main subsidiaries. 64% of the shareholders of the new bank were former shareholders of BPVN, with the rest being the former holders of BPI.[7] Banco Popolare also sold Banca Popolare di Mantova to Banca Popolare di Milano in 2008. In June 2009 the company became the first Italian bank to receive state aid from the Government of Italy due to the ongoing financial crisis.[8] It sold \u20ac1.5 billion in convertible bonds to the state.[8] On 1 January 2011 the group sold Banca Caripe to Banca Tercas, the bank only section in Abruzzo. In the same year most of the subsidiaries were absorbed into the parent companies, but remained as a brand and as internal bank divisions and departments. The incorporation of Credito Bergamasco was completed in 2014. In 2015 Banca Italease was absorbed. It became the leasing division of the bank.[9] In 2015 the equity stake in ARCA SGR was sold to Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna and Banca Popolare di Sondrio for \u20ac95.5 million.[10] In 2016 it was announced that the bank would be merged with Banca Popolare di Milano.

The bank also claimed that the new bank would be ranked as the third in terms of branches (above 8%) and more specifically the first in Lombardy (above 15.5% where BPMilano, BPMantova and BPL were located), the third in Veneto (above 9.5% where BPV was located) and the third in Piedmont (above 12.5% where BPN was located). As part of the deal Banco Popolare would also recapitalize \u20ac1 billion in order increases its capital quality.[11] Both banks had below 1 P/B ratio (which Banco Popolare had a higher discount), making the share capital of the new bank roughly composed of 54% shareholders of Banco Popolare and 46% BPM. As part of the merger and demutualization, Banco Popolare had set an exit price of \u20ac3.156 per shares for shareholders who did not vote or against the merger in the extraordinary shareholders' meeting in October 2016, which was calculated by the mean of the share price of the previous six months,[12] although it was still above the market price at that time.

Founded in 1946 in Bandini\u2019s hometown Forl\u00ec, the first Bandini used a modified Fiat 1100 engine, the body was made from hand hammered aluminum and the chassis from aviation-grade tubular steel. Many other post-war Italian sports car companies followed a similar design. But Bandini\u2019s sharp mind, racing knowledge and his eye for detail ensured that Bandini cars were a force to be reckoned with in Europe and the US. Interest in America surged when Bandini Siluros, with their screaming 750-cc engines and wildly flared front fenders, won SCCA class championships in 1955 and 1957. His slightly modified Crosley engines became famous thanks their DOHC Bandini heads. Bandini himself continued to race in Italy, including the Mille Miglia, while newer models were being built and developed at the factory. One of these included the new 1957 Sport International \"Saponetta\". It was a two-seat sports car with a tubular steel frame and room for engines of up to 1.0 liter. The design of the car body was very striking. The smooth lines and petite dimensions gave the car the Italian nickname \"Saponetta\" (little soap). The Formula 3 car of 1954[citation needed] had disc brakes on all four wheels, following closely on the 1951 C-type Jaguar. The Zagato bodied Bandini GT raced in Daytona and 12 Hours of Sebring.  The coup\u00e9 by Corna was a 1000 cc and the engine was mounted in front.  Ilario divided his time between design and manufacturing of the cars, and as a race driver. He entered and drove his cars in more than 60 races, both hillclimb events and track racing, including the Mille Miglia from 1947 until 1965, achieving 19 first-place finishes and 18 podiums in the 750cc and 1000cc classes.In the United States, Bandini cars won the SCCA HM class championship in 1955[1] thanks to driver Dolph Vilardi.  In 1957 Melvin Sachs won the HM class,[2] one of five Bandini's in the first ten positions. The successes resulted in Ilario being presented with the Gold Key of Daytona and later in 1981 the Laurea H.C. award in mechanical engineering from PRODEO university of New York. In 1959 he produced one of the most successful Formula Juniors.  Bandinis won SCCA Class HMod races well into the mid-1960s. A Bandini Siluro won the SCCA Southwest Regional Championship from 1961\u20131963 and the Saponetta took 3rd place in the National Hmod class in 1961.  Bandini continued to make one-off cars well into the 1980s. Ilario, sometimes known as the \"great Drake of Forli\" died in 1992. On 16 November 2002 the city of Forl\u00ec, Italy remembered Ilario Bandini who is considered one of the most important Italian constructors of performance sports and race cars. The city dedicated a plaza (town square) to honor his name and the racing cars that bear his name. Since 1992, in Bandini's last workshop, Ilario's family has preserved all documents and collected the most representative cars for display. Ten Bandinis are in the museum and are shown by appointment.  46 Bandinis exist in the world today and are acknowledged by the Register.  They are owned from the U.S. to Japan.

It is the world's largest pasta producer.[2] The company was founded in 1877 as a bakery shop in Parma, Italy by Pietro Barilla.  It remained in the hands of the Barilla family until 1971, when American chemical company W. R. Grace acquired controlling interest. However, Grace left day-to-day control in the hands of Pietro Barilla, grandson and namesake of the company founder. Pietro reacquired control in 1979, and the company has remained privately held ever since. It is now helmed by the elder Pietro Barilla's great-grandson, chairman Guido Barilla, and brothers and vice chairmen Luca Barilla and Paolo Barilla. They are the fourth generation of Barillas to lead the company. Barilla Group controls Barilla (multinational pasta maker), Mulino Bianco, Pavesi, Voiello, Alixir and Academia Barilla (Italy), Wasabr\u00f6d (Sweden), MISKO (Greece), Filiz (Turkey), Yemina and Vesta (Mexico) trademarks. The group produces many kinds of pasta, and is the world's leading pasta maker with 40\u201345% of the Italian market and 25% of the US market.[3] It produces pasta in over 120 shapes and sizes. Barilla brand pasta is sold in numerous restaurants worldwide, such as those belonging to the Pastamania chain.[4] It is also the leading seller of bakery products in Italy. Through its acquisition of the Swedish company Wasa, it is the world's leading producer of flatbread (a Scandinavian staple), selling 60,000 tons annually.[5] The company markets pasta in the US as being Italian (\"An Italian Favorite\" marketing) in flavor, but most of the product in the United States is actually made in Iowa or New York and not Italy. The wheat used is mainly local. Barilla Group has several production plants all over the world: in Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, the United States (in Ames, Iowa and Avon, New York), and Mexico. The company also operates mills in Italy, Greece, Sweden, Turkey, and the US. While its central office is in Parma, it has corporate offices in several other countries as well, such as Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the US, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, and Japan. Barilla's Italian production facilities are located at Parma, Foggia, Marcianise, Castiglione delle Stiviere, Cremona, Melfi, Rubbiano, Novara, and Ascoli Piceno.[6] Its plant in Greece (near Thiva) is the third largest in Europe.[7] The plant where the pasta was made is noted on the packaging by a code letter,[8] whereas products made in Italy are explicitly labeled as such.[9] The wheat used to make the final product is purchased from around the world.[9] In 2013, after the chairman Guido Barilla made comments regarding his opposition to adoption by gay families and unwillingness to showcase gay families in his advertisements,[10] some called for a boycott against Barilla products.[11][12][13] Guido later apoligized[14] and the company began advocating for LGBT causes.[15][16][17] Barilla Pasta has elected Bruno Serato to represent Barilla Group as their ambassador for World Pasta Day 2018.[18] The company has sponsored the Italian national basketball team on several occasions,[19] as well as the Italian race car driver Alex Zanardi.[20] ",

It produces the Benelli M3 12 gauge, used by American SWAT teams. Benelli Armi was founded in 1967 as an offshoot of the Benelli motorcycle factory that sold motorcycles through Montgomery Ward. Benelli and Benelli USA have been owned by Pietro Beretta SpA since 2000.[4] In 1911 Teresa Benelli invested in her 6 sons to begin an auto service company. Eventually their services expanded to include servicing motorcycles and even building their own. In 1967 they acted on their love of hunting as well as their belief in the semi-auto shotgun by developing firearms. They did this by teaming up with Bruno Civolani the developer of a new action and patenting the \"Inertia Driven\" mechanism.[5] Many Benelli shotguns utilize a inertia operating system developed by Bruno Civolani.[3] In 1999 Benelli introduced the Benelli M4 Super 90, a gas operated semi-automatic shotgun intended for military and law enforcement use. The Benelli Super Black Eagle, used by waterfowlers, was one of the first semi-automatic shotguns capable of firing the 2.75, 3, and 3.5\u00a0inch shotgun shells.[citation needed] ",

            "text": "Established in 1911, Benelli is one of the oldest Italian motorcycle manufacturers.[1] It once manufactured shotguns, although this part of the business is now a separate company. Benelli was established in Pesaro, Italy in 1911, which possibly makes it the oldest of Italian motorcycle factories in operation. (Moto Guzzi\u2014the oldest motorcycle factory in non-stop operation\u2014was established in 1921, and Peugeot is the world's oldest and still producing motorcycle factory due to establishing in 1898.) After losing her husband, the widow Teresa Benelli invested all of the family capital into the business in the hope that it would offer stable work for her six sons: Giuseppe, Giovanni, Francesco, Filippo, Domenico and Antonio (\"Tonino\"). She also sent Giuseppe and Giovanni to study Engineering in Switzerland. Initially the business had 6 employees in addition to the 5 brothers working (Tonino didn't work because he was too young.) In the beginning, it was just the Benelli Garage, which repaired bicycles and motorcycles, but was already able to produce all of the spare parts needed for repairs.[2] During World War I, Benelli worked hard fixing parts for the Italian machines in war and in 1919 the first motorcycle was presented to the public. In 1920 the company built its first complete engine in-house, a single-cylinder two-stroke 75 cc model, immediately adapted to a bicycle frame. A year later in 1921, Benelli built its first motorcycle, using their own engine which had by then become a 98 cc model. Two years after that, using a version specially designed for competitions, Tonino \"the terrible\" took to the track. He displayed an extraordinary natural talent as a rider and embarked on a very successful career which confirmed the company's exceptional capacity for development and production. Riding a Benelli 175, Tonino Benelli won four Italian championship titles in five years: in 1927, 1928 and 1930 with the single overhead camshaft (SOHC) version, and in 1931 with the double overhead camshaft (DOHC) version. Unfortunately, a bad crash during a race in 1932 cut short his brilliant career and on 27 September 1937 Tonino died following a \"silly\" road accident. As World War II loomed, the Benelli company debuted their four-cylinder supercharged 250cc racing bike. This was intended to compete in the 1940 season, building on Benelli's success in the 1939 Isle of Man TT Lightweight 250 cc race. With the start of the war, the Benelli Four was limited to competition in a handful of Italian domestic races. Wartime destruction caused Benelli to remain out of production until 1949. Unsold war motorcycles to be used by the Italian army were adapted to become civil motorcycles and generate income to restart operations. When production resumed, designs were still largely based on those of the pre-war period. In 1949, Giuseppe Benelli left the family concern to found the Motobi marque. By 1951 Benelli was offering a range consisting of 98cc and 125cc lightweights (the Leoncino or lion cub) and 350cc and 500cc singles. The Leoncino was available in both two-stroke and four-stroke forms. The need for cheap transport in post-war Italy meant that these lightweight models became immensely successful . Similar models were offered by Moto Guzzi, Ducati and Laverda, and the same economic conditions led to the growth in popularity of Vespa and Lambretta scooters. Benelli also sold motorcycles to American retailer Montgomery Ward, who rebranded them as Riverside and marketed them through their catalog. In 1962, when Motobi was not in good financial conditions, it was acquired by Benelli, and the combined company produced around 300 motorcycles a day and had 550 employees. Motobi designs continued in production under the Benelli name. In 1969, Benelli introduced the Benelli Tornado 650, a vertical twin designed primarily for sale in Great Britain and the US. The Tornado earned a reputation for reliability and high performance, despite its somewhat hefty weight at 480 pounds (220\u00a0kg). Benelli claimed at the time of launch that the Tornado was capable of 57\u00a0hp at 7,400rpm for a top speed of 117\u00a0mph.[3] The Tornado (later the Tornado S) was discontinued after 1974, when Benelli introduced a series of \"multis\" intended to compete with Japanese triples and fours. Towards the end of the 1960s, the arrival of Japanese manufacturers caused a crisis in the European motorcycle industry. The original Benelli company was heavily involved in the American motorcycle market, selling motorcycles under 350cc through Montgomery Ward. The advent of competition from Japan led to Benelli products (still largely of single cylinder pushrod design) losing popularity as they were perceived as old-fashioned in comparison to Hondas of the era which sported overhead cam engines with electric starters, in much the same way as the British motorcycle manufacturers such as Norton, BSA and Triumph were affected in the larger capacity sector. In 1973 Benelli was acquired by Argentinian industrialist Alejandro de Tomaso together with its competitor Moto Guzzi which led to the development of new models featuring multi-cylinder engines, such as the \"350 GTS\" and the \"500 Quattro\", and the Sei powered by a 747cc (later 906cc) six-cylinder in-line engine, which put the firm briefly ahead of the Japanese competition. Although technically advanced, Benelli motorcycles of the 1980s were plagued by problems, and the production was finally stopped in 1988 when the company was merged into Moto Guzzi to create \"Guzzi Benelli Moto S.p.A.\", and the production plants in Pesaro were sold. Benelli motorcycles from the 1970s and 1980s, particularly the Sei, often command higher prices than their contemporaries on the secondhand market.[4] After an unsuccessful attempt at revival in 1989 backed by Pesaro-based manufacturer Giancarlo Selci, in 1995 Andrea Merloni took charge. The Tornado Tre 900 super sport bike was launched in 2002, and the TNT, roadster some years later. Benelli is now part of motor Group Qianjiang, a corporation in Wenling, southeast China. Benelli Q.J. is located in Pesaro, with the same workforce in the same premises as previous proprietor Benelli S.p.A. Benelli S.p.A. recently forayed into the motorcycle market of India through a joint venture with DSK Group of India based in Pune where DSK holds 51% and benelli S.P.A holds 49% and sold more than 200 high end bikes within the first 4 months of launch. Benelli has launched six models in India, in a wide range of engine displacement and price. Includes the entry level Benelli TNT 25 with a 250 cc single cylinder engine, Benelli TNT 300 with 300cc twin cylinder engine, TNT 600i and 600GT with 600cc four-cylinder motor, TNT 899 with 898cc three-cylinder mill and the flagship TNT R with 1131cc three-cylinder power plant.[5] DSK-Benelli sold over 3000 units in India over 18 months from the start of sales, one third of them being the Inline-four cylinder engine Inline-four engine 600i, making them one of the fastest premium motorcycle selling brands in India.[6] Benelli also entered the closely guarded Iranian market in 2016 showcasing their bikes at Iran's IRIB (nikrun motor pasargad) conference center in the capital Tehran.[7] Tonino Benelli was the undisputed protagonist of the early racing successes. With an extraordinary natural talent for riding, he began a rewarding career that confirmed his exceptional technical skill and innovation within the company. In the saddle of a Benelli 175, Tonino won the title of Italian Champion in 1927, 1928 and 1930 riding the SOHC version, and in 1931 with the DOHC version. The numerous victories in the European World Championship were a prelude to one of the most sought after successes of all motorcycle producers: the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, at that time the most important race in the world. In 1939, Ted Mellors was victorious, racing in the saddle of the Benelli 250. In 1950, Dario Ambrosini also won the 1950 Isle of Man TT, repeating Mellors\u2019 success and consecrating his title by winning both the Italian and the World Championships. In the 1960s two extraordinary riders competed in the races: Tarquinio Provini, who won the Italian Championship with the 250 in 1965 and Renzo Pasolini who won the Championship with the 250 as well as the 350 in 1968 and 1969. In 1969, the enormous effort invested in competition was rewarded with the 250 world title thanks to Kel Carruthers, who also again won the Tourist Trophy in the same year. It would also mark the last world championship for a four-stroke motorcycle until the advent of the modern MotoGP era in 2003. Many of the most famous riders in the history of motorcycling raced with Benelli bikes, from Mike Hailwood to Jarno Saarinen. Former Australian Superbike champion Peter Goddard signed with Benelli in 2001.[8] ",

Benetti designs and constructs motoryachts, and is one of the leading builders of custom superyachts, having won the Showboats International magazine \"shipyard number 1\" award six times in a row, the only yard to have done so.[1] Founded in 1873,[2] when Lorenzo Benetti (1844\u20131914), bought the Darsena Luca shipyard to found the Benetti shipyard.[1] The yard built commercial vessels,[3] including fishing boats and Mediterranean trading ships. On his death in 1914, his sons Gino and Emilio took over, and renamed the yard Fratelli Benetti. They continued using wooden construction, but now built ocean-going ships, and some private yachts. After the death of Gino in 1927, his sons Gusieppe and Virgilio took over his share, while Maurizio and Bertani assisted their father Emilio. During World War II, the yard built medium-sized military vessels in steel, but due to highly effective bombing, the production was severely limited. After the war, and with restrictions on Italy on what she could produce militarily, the yard produced the first steel-hulled diesel powered vessel in the locality, the \"Raphaelo\". In 1954, Fratelli Benetti split its sailing and yacht business (Gino's family),[1] from the commercial ship building business which continues under the name M&B Benetti (Emilio's family). Emilio has a holding in both companies, and chairs both companies. In 1963, Emilio died and the running of Fratelli Benetti was taken over by Gusieppe and his son Lorenzo. Lorenzo was the driver of the yacht business, moving instantly from wooden to steel construction, and designing three styles of yacht which brought the name Benetti to the world: the Delfino, the Tirreno and the Meditteraneo lines (from 18 to 33 metres). Demand for these vessels outstripped the capabilities of the yard. In 1978, the yard launched the \"Viano\", a sailing yacht which on corrected times won the Admirals Cup. In 1979, the yard launches \"Nabila\" for Adnan Khashoggi, which at 83 metres and 2,465 tonnes was the largest yacht of its time. Lorenzo died in 1980 and the company fell into financial difficulties until 1984, when it was purchased by Paolo Vitelli, the owner of Azimut, who renamed it Benetti Shipyard.[1][2] In 1988, Benetti built a ship to challenge for the transatlantic Blue Riband award but its efforts proved unsuccessful. The company is now part of the Azimut I Benetti group, also owner of Fraser Yachts[4]. Viareggio is the historical shipyard, in 1990 Benetti took over the 47,000sq m Lusben yard to allow the construction of both the Azimut range up to 100\u00a0ft, and the composite Benetti range and in 1997 was vastly expanded to 10,000 square metres (12,000\u00a0sq\u00a0yd) to allow indoor building of yachts up to 70 m. In 2003 was acquired the area of the SEC yard which went bankrupt in the previous years in order to expand the production. It was purchased the Siar-Moschino yard in Fano in 1998, taking the total capacity to 44,000 square metres (53,000\u00a0sq\u00a0yd). The yard has a 60 m wharf in the port. Azimut-Benetti acquired the Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando in 2003 when the Livorno yard was in severe economic difficulties. The old shipyard has been partially demolished to make space for a residential and commercial area named Porta a Mare (Gate to sea), the part toward the entrance of the harbour was transformed with the construction of six huge sheds were to laid down the yachts. The Morosini slip was dismantled and was erected a Marina where to berth the yachts built. Benetti Livorno shipyard has a covered area of 30,000 sq m, a production area of 28,000 sq m, an open area of 130,000 sq m and a total area of 190,000 sq m. Benetti Tradition is model of traditional yachts built by Benetti Yard. With fiberglass hull sizes up to 99 feet, powered by the Caterpillar C18 the maximum speed of Benetti Tradition 99 is 15 knots. Benetti Classic is a classical yacht, with a style very similar to those of Benetti Tradition but with a larger hull size. With fiberglass hull sizes up to 143feet, powered by the Caterpillar C30 with higher power of 1,650\u00a0hp (each), the maximum speed of Benetti Classic is 16 knots. Benetti Vision is a more modern style yacht with large measurements up to 143 feet. The beauty of this yacht is in the whole atmosphere and nice shape and exterior. Benetti Vision has two main engines of Caterpillar 3508B, with maximum power of 1,300\u00a0hp (each). This gives the yacht a maximum speed of 15 knots. This is a slightly less than Benetti Classic series, but with lower fuel consumption. The yacht is very beautiful designed interior with equipment for watersports and fishing. Benetti FB is the last series. This is the manufacturer's first series of luxury yachts. Some of the names of the yachts built by Benetti in the series FB are called Amnesia, I Dinasty, Wind, Alibella and many more. All of these yachts are from the highest level of luxury, comfort and expenses. In May 2010, Benetti yachts announced Benetti imagination, which is first super yacht from Benetti\u2019s new 47 meter line. Imagination is designed by Stefano Natucci and Francois Zuretti.[5] In 2011 the company delivered a \"Benetti Vision 145\"\u2014their 16th. It had a specification of 390 tons fully loaded. In 2015, Benetti partnered with Henrik Fisker to launch new series of 164 ft super yachts called Benetti Fisker 50. Benetti built hundreds of yachts over the years.[6] Here is an extract of the Benetti fleet of yachts:  Benetti have built super yachts for many customers, including:  ",

Benetton Group has a network of about 5,000 stores in the main international markets.[1] In 1965, the Benettons opened their first store in Belluno[2] and three years after in Paris. The company's core business consists of clothing brands United Colors of Benetton[3] and Sisley.[4] The Group has a network of about 5,000 stores around the world.[1] Benetton is known for its sports sponsorships, and for its \"United Colors\" advertising campaign. In 1982, Benetton hired Oliviero Toscani as creative director, which led to a change in advertising focus towards raising awareness for various issues worldwide.[5] In 1984, Toscani photographed the first multiracial ad for the brand.[2] In 1989, Toscani refocused Benetton's advertising strategy under the \"United Colors of Benetton\" campaign. The campaign's graphic, billboard-sized ads depicted a variety of shocking subjects, including the deathbed scene of a man (AIDS activist David Kirby) dying from AIDS.[6] Another ad featured a bloodied, unwashed newborn baby with umbilical cord still attached. The newborn ad prompted roughly 650 complaints to the British Advertising Standards Authority, which noted in its 1991 annual report that the Benetton baby ad \"attracted more complaints than we have ever previously known.\"[7] In 2000, Benetton was included in the reference publication Guinness World Records for the \"Most Controversial Campaign.\"[8] In November 2011, Benetton created the UNHATE Foundation, launching a worldwide communication campaign described as an invitation to leaders and citizens of the world to combat the \"culture of hatred.\"[9] Benetton claimed the campaign was created to serve as its corporate social responsibility strategy.[10] The UNHATE poster series uses altered images of political and religious leaders, such as then-President of the United States Barack Obama and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, then President of Venezuela, kissing each other.[11][12] Following Vatican protests, Benetton removed an ad purportedly showing Pope Benedict XVI kissing Ahmed Mohamed el Tayeb, the imam of Egypt's Al Azhar mosque.[13][14][15] Benetton won the Press Grand Prix at the 2012 Cannes Ad festival for its Unhate campaign.[16][17] In November 2017, Benetton launched a campaign in collaboration with Devbhumi, a company owned by rural women from India's remote Uttarakhand region. The initiative claims to empower more than 6,000 rural women artisans in India.[18][19] Benetton Group entered Formula One as a sponsor of Tyrrell in 1983, then Alfa Romeo in 1984; this arrangement was extended to both Alfa and Toleman in 1985. Benetton Formula Ltd. was formed at the end of 1985 when the Toleman and Spirit teams were sold to the Benetton family. The team saw its greatest success under Flavio Briatore, who managed the team from 1990 to 1997. Michael Schumacher won his first Drivers' Championships with the team in 1994 and 1995, and the team won their only Constructors' title in 1995. From 1996, the team raced under an Italian licence although it continued to be based, like Toleman, in Oxfordshire in England. The team was bought by Renault for US$120 million in 2000 and was rebranded Renault F1 in 2002. In 1979, Benetton first sponsored their (then amateur) local rugby team, A.S. Rugby Treviso. Benetton Rugby has since become a major force in Italian rugby, with 11 league titles and supplying many players to the national team.[20] Benetton Group has also sponsored Treviso Basket (1982\u20132012) and Sisley Volley (1987\u20132012). The 1983 season Tyrrell 011, showing the company's logo at the time. Schumacher's B194 of the 1994 season. Riccardo Patrese's Alfa Romeo Benetton 185T. Benetton has faced criticism from Mapuche organizations over its purchase of traditional Mapuche lands in Patagonia.[21] The Curi\u00f1anco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007.[22] The company have published a position statement regarding the Mapuche in Patagonia.[23] Benetton aroused suspicion when they considered using RFID tracking chips on clothes to monitor inventory. A boycott site alleges the tracking chips \"can be read from a distance and used to monitor the people wearing them.\"[24] Issues of consumer privacy were raised and the plan was shelved. Benetton's position on RFID technology is also available on their website.[25] PETA launched a boycott campaign against Benetton for buying wool from farmers who practiced mulesing. Benetton has since agreed to buy nonmulesed wool and has further urged the wool industry to adopt the PETA and Australian Wool Growers Association agreement to end mulesing.[26] Benetton's position statement on the mulesing controversy is available on their website.[27] On 24 April 2013, the eight-storey Rana Plaza commercial building collapsed outside Dhaka that housed one of the factories where Benetton makes its clothing.[28] At least 1,130 people died.[29] Benetton first denied reports linking production of their clothing at the factory, but clothes and documents linked to Benetton were discovered at the disaster site.[30][31][32] Of the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only nine attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. Several companies refused to sign including Walmart, Carrefour, Bonmarch\u00e9, Mango, Auchan and Kik. The agreement was signed by Primark, Loblaw, Bonmarche and El Corte Ingles.[33] A year after the collapse, Benetton faced international protests after failing to pay any compensation to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund.[34][35] Protests included shutting down Benetton's flagship Oxford Street store in London.[36] On April 2015, Benetton Group announced that it has doubled compensation for Rana Plaza victims recommended by independent assessors (PWC AND WRAP) and applied the principles of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety to global suppliers. Benetton's engagement for Bangladesh is available on their website.[37] ",

Its firearms are used worldwide for a variety of civilian, law enforcement, and military purposes. Sporting arms account for three-quarters of sales; Beretta is also known for marketing shooting clothes and accessories. Founded in the 16th century, Beretta is the oldest active manufacturer of firearm components in the world.[1] In 1526 its inaugural product was arquebus barrels; by all accounts Beretta-made barrels equipped the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571.[2] Beretta has supplied weapons for every major European war since 1650.[3] Val Trompia, a northern Italian river valley in the Province of Brescia, Lombardy, has been mined for iron ore since the time of the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, Val Trompia was known for its ironworks; after the Renaissance it came to be a center for the manufacture of weapons.[4] By the mid 16th century Val Trompia had forty ironworks, supplied by fifty mines and eight smelters. The birthplace of Beretta is in the village of Gardone located on the banks of the Mella river, in the middle of Val Trompia (i.e., between the upper valley and lower valley).[1] The Beretta forge was in operation from about 1500,[5] although the first documented transaction is a contract dated October 3, 1526 for 185 arquebus barrels, for which the Republic of Venice was to pay 296 ducats to Maestro di Canne (master gun-barrel maker) Bartolomeo Beretta (in Italian).[4] The original account document for the order of those barrels is now stored in the Archivio di Stato di Venezia (in Italian) in Venice.[6] By the end of the 17th century, Beretta had become the second largest gun barrel maker in Gardone.[1] Under the guild system, the knowledge of gun barrel fabrication that was bequeathed to Jacopo (1520/25 \u2013 \u2026) from his father Bartolomeo (1490 \u2013 1565/68)[7] was then passed on to his own son Giovannino (1550 \u2013 post 1577), and to his grandson Giovan Antonio (1577 \u2013 post 1649)[8] and so on until guilds were abolished by Napoleon after his conquest of Venetian Republic in 1797.[1] Beretta has been owned by the same family for almost five hundred years[9] and is a founding member of Les Henokiens, an association of bicentenary companies that are family owned and operated.[10] In 1918, the Beretta Model 1918, one of the first submachine guns in the world, was fielded by the Italian army. Beretta manufactured rifles and pistols for the Italian military until the 1943 Armistice between Italy and the Allied forces during World War II. With the Wehrmacht's control of northern Italy, the Germans seized Beretta and continued producing arms until the 1945 German surrender in Italy.[4] In that time, the quality of the exterior finish of the weapons diminished and was much more inferior to both the pre-war and mid-war weapons, but their operation remained excellent.[11] The last shipment of Type I Rifles left Venice for Japan in a U-boat in 1942. After World War II, Beretta was actively involved in repairing the American M1 Garands given to Italy by the U.S. Beretta modified the M1 into the Beretta BM-59 rifle, which is similar to the M14 battle rifle; armourers consider the BM-59 rifle to be superior to the M14 rifle in some ways, because it is more accurate under certain conditions.[12][13] After the war, Beretta continued to develop firearms for the Italian Army and police, as well as the civilian market.[14] In the 1980s, Beretta enjoyed a renewal of popularity in North America after its Beretta 92 pistol was selected as the service handgun for the United States Army under the designation of \"M9 pistol\".[2] In the 1970s, Beretta also started a manufacturing plant in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. A contract between Beretta and the Brazilian government was signed, under which Beretta produced Beretta 92s for the Brazilian Army until 1980. Later this plant was sold to Taurus, who continues to manufacture the Beretta 92 under the name of PT92 using the same tools and labour which Beretta used, without the need for a license from Beretta, since the design is based on the original Beretta 92, for which the patents are expired.[15] Beretta acquired several domestic competitors (notably Benelli and Franchi) and some foreign companies (notably in Finland) in the late 1980s.[16] The Vatican Bank has been for years the main shareholder of the Pietro Beretta's group[17][18] and during the 80s it also had a relevant stakeholding in the Italian leading technology group Finmeccanica.[19] Today, Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta (Beretta S.p.A) is run by Franco Gussalli Beretta, President and CEO.[20] The traditional father-to-son Beretta dynasty was interrupted when Ugo Gussalli Beretta assumed the firm's control; uncles Carlo and Giuseppe Beretta were childless; Ugo married into the Beretta family and adopted the last name Beretta. His sons are now direct descendants through their mother's side of the family. Beretta is known for its broad range of firearms: side-by-side shotguns, over-and-under shotguns, semi-automatic shotguns, hunting rifles, express rifles, assault rifles, submachine guns, lever- and  bolt-action rifles, single- and double-action revolvers and semi-automatic  pistols.[21] The parent company, Beretta Holding, also owns Beretta USA, Benelli, Franchi, SAKO, Stoeger, Tikka, Uberti, and the Burris Optics company. The model Beretta 92FS was the primary side arm of the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force, designated the M9 pistol.[22] In 1985, Beretta was chosen after a controversial competition to produce the M9, winning a contract for 500,000 pistols.[23][24] A condition of the original agreement was domestic manufacturer of the M9.[25][26] In 2019, the 9mm version of the SIG Sauer P320 was selected to replace the M9 throughout the US Armed Forces.[27] Wilson, R.

Originating as a brand of extra-virgin olive oil, in which it was the global market leader,[1] pasta sauces and ready meals are now sold under the brand name as well.[2][3] In 1865 (154\u00a0years ago)\u00a0(1865), the Bertolli company was founded by Francesco Bertolli and his wife, Caterina, in Lucca, Tuscany, Kingdom of Italy.  They began by selling produce such as wine, cheese, olives, and olive oil.[4] In 2008, the company was bought by Unilever, which then sold the olive oil business to Grupo SOS (currently Grupo Deoleo), Spain\u2019s second-largest food group, for \u00a3500m as part of its disposal of non-core businesses. The transaction included the sale of the Italian Maya, Dante, and San Giorgio olive oil and seed oil businesses, as well as the factory at Inveruno, Province of Milan, Lombardy.[5] In August 2012, the frozen foods business under the Bertolli brand name was sold by Unilever to ConAgra Foods.[6] On 22 May 2014, Unilever agreed to sell its North American pasta sauce business under the Rag\u00fa and Bertolli brands to the Mizkan Group of Japan for US$2.15 billion,[3][7] while these brands are owned in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Symington's, a private label food manufacturer.[8] The frozen meals sold by Bertolli are branded under \"Meals for One\", \"Meals for Two\" and \"Dessert\" categories.[9] Sales fell in the 2014 year for the frozen foods brands. ConAgra also focused in 2015 on growth in private-label products that retailers sell under their own brand.[10] Bertolli's market share in pasta sauce in 2015 was 7.2% behind Ragu and Prego.[11] Some controversy emerged in 2010 when Bertolli Extra Virgin Olive Oil was identified as one of the olive oils mislabeled as extra virgin in a study by University of California, Davis.[12]  In 2018, parent company Deoleo agreed to pay a US$7 million settlement[13] to resolve a class action lawsuit which had alleged that the company had misrepresented Bertolli olive oil, and committed to undertake several actions to correct such misrepresentation.[14] The suit had alleged that it was misleading for Bertolli to advertise its olive oil as being \"Imported from Italy\" when the oils actually came from olives grown and pressed in Greece, Chile, Spain, Australia, Turkey, and Tunisia, and had merely been mixed and bottled in Italy.[15] Deoleo removed the phrase \"Imported from Italy\" from its products and committed not to use similar phrasing in the future unless the oil is derived entirely from olives grown and pressed in Italy.[14] Additionally, the suit alleged that the clear bottles used by Bertolli for its oil were inadequate to protect them from sunlight and temperature extremes, such that the olive oil would not meet the \"extra virgin\" quality standard by the time it reached consumers.[15] As part of this settlement, Deoleo implemented several new practices to help ensure that its oil would meet the \"extra virgin\" standard at the time of sale and use:[14] On November 15, 2018, parent company Deoleo was granted an injunction against Natural Solutions Magazine, preventing the magazine from continuing false and misleading statements against Bertolli and one of Deoleo's other brands Carapelli.[13] ",

Beta motorcycles have been used by world trials champions such as Jordi Tarr\u00e9s, Dougie Lampkin and Albert Cabestany. Beta has its origins in 1904 as a bicycle manufacturing company named \"Societ\u00e0 Giuseppe Bianchi\",[1] originally based in Florence. The company started making motorcycles in 1948. The name Beta comes from the initials of Enzo Bianchi and Arrigo Tosi, who ran the company at that time. Focusing on two-stroke bikes through the 1950s and 1960s, the company started focusing development and production to off-road motorcycles in the 1970s. Beta have produced motorcycles for observed trials since the early 1980s and are now one of the leading manufacturers.[2] Unlike the Trail and Enduro models, the trials bike have used Beta's own engines. Beta made a range of motocross and enduro bikes during the 1970s and 1980s. The Beta Enduro bikes have used KTM engines since their return in 2004, though 2009 sees the launch of bikes with Beta's own power units. The Alp trail motorcycle models have used air-cooled Suzuki DR-model engines and have a good reputation as commuters and 'green-lane' trail bikes. With a low seat height and a reputation as an easy to ride motorcycle, they are ideal for beginners to off-road riding.  Beta RR Motard Track ",

Edoardo Bianchi S.p.A, commonly known as Bianchi ([\u02c8bja\u014bki]) is the world's oldest bicycle manufacturing company in existence, having pioneered the use of equal-sized wheels with pneumatic rubber tires.[citation needed] The company was founded in Italy in 1885 and in addition to bicycles it produced motorcycles from 1897 to 1967. In 1955 the joint-venture Autobianchi was created together with Fiat and Pirelli for the manufacturing of cars \u2013 Autobianchi was subsequently sold to Fiat in 1969. Throughout its modern era, Bianchi has been associated with the Italian Giro d'Italia and Tour de France winners, Fausto Coppi,[1] Marco Pantani and Felice Gimondi. Edoardo Bianchi, a 21-year-old medical instrument maker, started his bicycle-manufacturing business in a small shop at 7 Via Nirone, Milan in 1885. Bianchi pioneered the front-wheel caliper brake. Since May 1997, the company has been part of Cycleurope Group, which is owned by the Swedish company of Grimaldi Industri AB. Bianchi and Ferrari announced in July 2017 a partnership to produce a new range of 'high-end' models. The SF01 was their first collaboration bike.[2] data from Bianchi website[3] These models are also manufactured with women's-specific geometry under the name Dama Bianca (\"Lady in White\"), a reference to champion Bianchi rider Fausto Coppi's lover Giulia Occhini. Manufactured according to a configuration and with materials common in the late 20th century The Bianchi reputation began when the company sponsored Giovanni Tommasello, the winner of the Grand Prix de Paris sprint competition in 1899. Fifteen years later it was making 45,000 bicycles, 1,500 motorcycles and 1,000 cars a year. In 1935 Bianchi sponsored Costante Girardengo, one of the first Italian stars on the road, and its bicycle sales rose to 70,000 a year.[4] In 1950 Fausto Coppi won the Paris\u2013Roubaix on a Bianchi equipped with what was later named the Campagnolo Paris\u2013Roubaix derailleur gear, for which Bianchi bicycles featured the necessary special drop-outs until 1954. He won the race by two and a half minutes on a bicycle equipped with Universal brakes, Bianchi steel handlebars and stem, a Regina chain and a four-speed freewheel with shaped teeth. It also had Nisi rims, Campagnolo hubs and Pirelli tyres. It was made for sale only in 57 and 59\u00a0cm, smaller than the bike that Coppi used.[1]  A variation known as the Campione Del Mondo followed Coppi's win in the 1953 world championship. Riders of different eras have been associated with Bianchi including Felice Gimondi, who continues his association with the company.[4]  Recent riders include Danilo Di Luca, Mario Cipollini, Gianni Bugno, Laurent Fignon, Marco Pantani, Moreno Argentin and Jan Ullrich.  Until 2007, Bianchi was a cosponsor of the UCI ProTour team, Liquigas. It did not supply teams from 1959 to 1964 nor from 1967 to 1972.[5] In October 2011, for the 2012 season, it was announced that Bianchi had been signed to a two-year deal to co-sponsor and supply bikes to the UCI ProTeams Vacansoleil-DCM[6] and Androni Giocattoli-Venezuela. These sponsorships continued in 2013 and for 2014, with Vacansoleil-DCM ceasing to exist, Bianchi again supplied Androni Giocattoli-Venezuela for a further year, and the then new Belkin Pro Cycling Team. In 2015, the latter became Team LottoNL-Jumbo and Bianchi's only UCI Pro Continental sponsored road team.[7] The most demanding rider may have been Pantani. Sara Mercante, head of Bianchi's research and development, said: \"Pantani had very specific ideas about what he wanted. He had 30 different frames a year from us\u2014with different angles and weights on each one. He changed his bike after every ride. I'd go and meet him during the Giro d'Italia and the Tour and discuss improvements with him. He'd ask to have the geometry changed by, say, half a degree, just to make sure the bike was absolutely perfect. He'd want different angles for different races. He's ask us to tweak the length of the top tube by a millimetre or by half a degree. Pantani was quite obsessive.\"[8] Bianchi is currently headed up by CEO Bob Ippolito, who before joining Bianchi was the Executive Vice President and General Manager of Pacific Cycle, headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. Bianchi bicycles are traditionally painted Celeste, a turquoise also known as Bianchi Green, (and sometimes, incorrectly Tiffany Blue, a trademarked colour).  Contradictory myths say Celeste is the colour of the Milan sky, the eye colour of a former queen of Italy for whom Edoardo Bianchi made a bicycle (the crowned eagle of the company logo is an adaptation of the former royal crest) and that it was a mixture of surplus military paint. The shade has changed over the years, sometimes more blue, then more green.[1] Bianchi USA is the United States division of Bianchi based in Hayward, California.[9][10] It oversees the production of bicycles built in Taiwan and in Italy for the worldwide market. Bianchi also took part in motorcycle races, where one of its first riders was Tazio Nuvolari, whom Ferdinand Porsche called \"the greatest driver of the past, the present, and the future.\"[11] The company began making trucks in the 1930s and supplied the Italian army during World War II . It was that that brought the end of production shortly after peace returned because the factory had been so heavily bombed. Bianchi continued with motorcycles, particularly the 125cc Bianchina and the Aquilotto, an auxiliary motor for a conventional bicycles. Bianchi took on Lino Tonti as its research engineer in 1959. It produced 250, 350 and 500cc machines and took part in grands prix in 1960. The company also produced a model for the Italian army and a civilian scooter, the Orsetto 80. Piaggio bought out Bianchi Motorcycles in 1967. In 1955, Bianchi created a car brand, Autobianchi, in collaboration with Pirelli and Fiat. The three turned out only a handful of models, almost exclusively small cars, the biggest being the short-lived Autobianchi A111. Traditionally, Autobianchi motor vehicles cost more than equivalent Fiat models. Fiat used Autobianchi to test new production concepts such as glass fibre and front-wheel drive. Eventually, Fiat bought out Autobianchi and integrated it with Lancia. Autobianchi are no longer in production beginning from 1995 when, everywhere except Italy, its Y10 hatchback was rebranded a Lancia. ",

            "text": "Bimota is a small Italian manufacturer of custom and production motorcycles. It was founded in 1973 in Rimini, Italy by Valerio Bianchi, Giuseppe Morri, and Massimo Tamburini. The company name is a portmanteau derived from the first two letters of each of the three founders' surnames, Bianchi Morri Tamburini. Because the state of frame design and overall packaging was poor,[1] Bimota concentrated initially on building high-quality motorcycles around existing engines. From the beginning they customised the top models of Suzuki, Honda and Kawasaki. During the late 1970s, Bimota also helped develop and build motorcycles branded as Lamborghinis.[citation needed] In the 1980s they also customised Yamaha and Ducati motorcycles. Bimota's co-founder and long-time chief designer Tamburini has been an influential player in the development of other Italian brands, most significantly his work on the popular Ducati 916, the Ducati Paso, and the MV Agusta F4; other designers such as current Bimota chief Sergio Robbiano have also been involved with larger-volume manufacturers. Bimota models currently in production include the DB5, DB6, DB7, DB9 and the Tesi, with a DB8 featuring the Ducati 1198 engine in development. The latest model features the Tesi 3D which along with the co-designed Vyrus is said to be the only bike on production to house Hub Steering. Bimota first experienced international racing success in 1980 when Jon Ekerold, a true privateer, won the 350cc world championship on a Yamaha-powered Bimota.[2] They also experienced success in the early years of the Superbike World Championship. Virginio Ferrari won the 1987 Formula TT title aboard a YB4 EI, partnering with Davide Tardozzi. Tardozzi won five races in the inaugural 1988 world superbike championship, more than any other competitor, but inconsistent results relegated him to third place in the final standings.[3] After many years without success, the Australian rider Anthony Gobert caused a major shock in 2000 by winning a wet race at Philip Island on a Bimota SB8R. The Alstare team entered a Bimota package into World Superbikes in 2014 for riders Ayrton Badovini and Christian Iddon, however the bike initially did not have enough units in production to pass the championship's homoglation rules. As a compromise, the bikes were allowed to enter from round 2, but ineligible for points until homoglation is achieved. At the end of the year the team finished unclassified and disqualified. Bimota YB3 Bimota SB6R The V Due, introduced in 1997, had a design flaw with its engine.[4]  Bimota was forced to ditch the novel fuel injection system and re-engineer the entire engine.[4] Bimota ultimately recalled the entire run of the V Due, and made an improved version, the 'Evoluzione'. Only 340 original V Dues and 21 Evoluziones were built.[4]  While this was occurring, during the 2000 World Superbike season, one of Bimota's main sponsors disappeared, owing the company a great deal of money.  The combination of events forced Bimota to file for bankruptcy and close their doors. A new group of investors purchased the rights to the Bimota name and designs and restarted the company. The investors that bought Bimota, Marco Chiancianesi who is the current president and his business partner Daniele Longoni are both active Scientologists.[5] Recent reports paint a less optimistic picture for the future of Bimota. In 2017, the factory at Rimini reportedly closed[6] with spares and incomplete bikes mothballed elsewhere, possibly Switzerland. ",

            "text": "Birra Moretti is an Italian brewing company, founded in Udine in 1859 by Luigi Moretti.[1] In 1996 the company was acquired by Heineken International. The brewing plant in Udine was sold to the newly formed Birra Castello S.p.A.; Moretti is now a brand of Heineken.[2] Birra Moretti was founded in 1859 by Luigi Moretti in Udine, which at that time was still part of the Austrian Empire, as the Beer and Ice Factory. The first bottles went on sale in 1860. The company was initially expected to produce 250,000 litres of beer a year, enough to meet the provincial demand.[3] The Moretti family continued to own the brewery and business until 1989, when it was sold to a consortium of other brewers, then in 1996 it was bought by the Dutch firm of Heineken.[4] The company also now owns the Birra Moretti trademark.[5] The original factory in Udine closed in 1992, after brewing was transferred to San Giorgio di Nogaro, also in Friuli. Following the finding by the Italian Antitrust Authority that Heineken occupied a dominant position in the Italian market,[6] the company was forced to sell the brewery in San Giorgio di Nogaro in 1997. It was subsequently bought by a new brewing consortium called the Birra Castello group, which now owns the property. Production of Birra Moretti beers was then moved to various other plants around Italy controlled by the Heineken group, such as those at Assemini, Comun Nuovo, Massafra, and Pollein. In 2015, Heineken launched six new Birra Moretti products: two new Radler, Birra Moretti Radler Gazzosa, and Chinotto as well as six beers dedicated to the culinary traditions of Italian regions: Birra Moretti to Friuli, Birra Moretti Sicilian, Beer Moretti Piedmontese, Birra Moretti Tuscan, Birra Moretti Apulian, and that of Lucana.[7] On the company's official website, it is said that in 1942 the Commendatore Lao Menazzi Moretti saw an elderly mustached gentleman sitting at a table in the historical trattoria Boschetti of Tricesimo in the province of Udine. Moretti, thinking that the man could represent his beer very well, decided he would ask permission to photograph him in exchange for a reward to the man's liking. \"Che al mi dedi di bevi, mi baste\" - said the man in the Friulian language, or \"Give me to drink, enough for me\".[8] That photo was later handed over to the illustrator Segala, alias Franca Segala, who designed the famous manifesto.[9] Another version, however, states that the photo was taken by the German photographer Erika Groth-Schachtenberger in 1939. The photo portrayed a Tyrolean farmer from Thaur in Tirol, only a few kilometers from Innsbruck. Groth would not have authorized the use of his picture if he knew it would be used for the Moretti advertising campaigns in 1956. He would see himself in a billboard and this discovery would also have resulted in a legal dispute.[10][11][12] Over the years, the Moustache was played by various actors; the most familiar face was that of the famous actor and voice actor Marcello Tusco, replaced after his sudden death by Orso Maria Guerrini. There are six beers under the Birra Moretti brand.[13]  Birra Moretti is the main brand, a 4.6% abv pale lager launched in 1859; followed by La Rossa, a 7.2% strong dark lager or doppelbock. Other brands include: From 1997 to 2008, the Birra Moretti sponsored Birra Moretti Trophy, an invitational summer football tournament. The first three editions were held in Udine, the birthplace of the company. Each edition saw the participation of three teams competing for 45 minutes like many other friendly summer tournaments. After the first three editions, the tournament moved first to the Stadio San Nicola in Bari and, then to the  Stadio San Paolo in Naples from 2005 to 2008. Stadio Moretti was built in Udine as a multi-use stadium. The capacity of the stadium was 25,000 spectators. It also hosted speedway events. The stadium was first used as the home of the Udinese Calcio football matches. The venue, however, moved to the Stadio Friuli in 1976. Stadio Moretti was demolished in 1988 and in its place now stands a city park, which was named after the great soccer player, Udine Alfredo Foni. Birra Moretti Football, or simply BMC, was a football online game whose players, coaches and fans are real people. The site was opened on 6 June 2006. ",

            "text": "Bizzarrini S.p.A. was an Italian automotive manufacturer in the 1960s founded by former Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Iso engineer Giotto Bizzarrini. The company built a small number of highly developed and advanced sport and racing automobiles before failing in 1969. Notable models include the 5300 GT Strada and the P538S. Originally Prototipi Bizzarrini s.r.l., the name was changed to Bizzarrini S.p.A. in 1966. The Bizzarrini marque has been revived with a number of concept cars in the 2000s. Giotto Bizzarrini was born in Livorno, Italy in 1926. His father was a rich landowner who came from a family with strong roots in Tuscany and the city of Livorno. His grandfather, also named Giotto Bizzarrini, was a biologist who had worked with Guglielmo Marconi on his inventions, especially the radio, following which one of the Livorno Library sections was named The Bizzarrini Library. Bizzarrini graduated as an engineer in the University of Pisa in 1953. He taught briefly before joining Alfa Romeo in 1954. He worked for Alfa Romeo from 1954 to 1957. He began working for Ferrari in 1957, eventually becoming controller of experimental, Sports and GT car development. He worked at Ferrari as a developer, designer, test driver, and chief engineer for five years. His developments there included  the Ferrari 250 TR, the Ferrari 250 GT SWB (Short Wheelbase Berlinetta or Berlinetta Passo Corto), and the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO. Bizzarrini was fired by Ferrari during the \"palace revolt\" of 1961. He became part of Automobili Turismo e Sport (ATS)), a company started by the ex-Ferrari engineers to build a Formula 1 single seater and a GT sport car, the A.T.S. Serenissima. One of ATS's financial backers, Count Giovanni Volpi, owner of Scuderia Serenissima, hired Bizzarrini to upgrade a Ferrari 250 GT SWB, with chassis number #2819GT to GTO specifications. This resulted in the Ferrari 250 GT SWB Drogo also known as the \"Breadvan\". Bizzarrini's engineering company, Societa Autostar, was commissioned to design a V-12 engine for a GT car to be built by another dissatisfied Ferrari customer, Ferruccio Lamborghini. Lamborghini considered the resulting engine to be too highly strung, and ordered that it be detuned. Bizzarrini worked since 1964 for Iso Rivolta and developed three models: Iso Rivolta GT, Iso Grifo both A3L and A3C versions. His work was to develop a pressed steel frame chassis for Iso cars. Renzo Rivolta hired him as consultant to the Iso Gordon GT project which became the Iso Rivolta GT. The Iso Gordon GT prototype was developed from the Gordon-Keeble. The Gordon Keeble GT was designed in 1960 by Giorgetto Giugiaro. Bizzarrini tested the car and was impressed by the powerful V8 Corvette engine and the rear De Dion tube suspension used for the GT: \"Rivolta had me test the prototype. I liked its De Dion tube and especially the Corvette engine. It was the first time I had driven one. It was superior to Ferrari's engines, having the same power, but with a more immediate throttle response.\"The Iso Rivolta GT was a Giugiaro-designed four-seater with beautiful body, speed, comfort and handling, and was a successful car for Iso, with 799 units sold. Powered by a 327\u00a0in3 (5.36\u00a0L) Chevrolet Corvette V8 engine with a classic De Dion rear suspension design with pressed steel monocoque bodywork over pressed steel frame chassis. Unveiled to the press in 1963, production continued until 1970. The Iso Grifo A3L was a monstrous idea for a super coup\u00e9, the L coming from Lusso. The result of the brilliant Giugiaro and Bizzarrini working together, it was based on a shortened Iso Rivolta GT chassis and was debuted at the 1963 Turin show. The Grifo epitomised the 1960s Italian style with its handsome low and wide handmade bodywork. It was the fastest production car tested by Autocar Magazine in 1966 with a top speed of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h). Later versions of the Grifo were powered by a big block Chevrolet Corvette 435\u00a0bhp (324\u00a0kW; 441\u00a0PS) engine. These 90 handbuilt units are distinguishable by the raised \"pagoda style\" scoop bonnet. Some of these Iso Grifo 7 Litri units were rebuilt later with even bigger engines. The idea of Bizzarrini was to use the 3AL cars for competition. The competition versions of the Grifo were named Iso Grifo A3C, C for Competizione or Corsa. A new lightweight riveted aluminium body was designed and built by Piero Drogo. It was an aggressively-designed machine, oriented to endurance races. It uses normal Iso underpinnings but the engine was moved further back in the chassis frame than the Grifo A3L, protruding well into the driver's cabin, fitted with hot cams and fed by four big Weber carburetors, giving more than 400\u00a0bhp (298\u00a0kW; 406\u00a0PS). Around 29 A3C sport cars were built under the Iso name. Five of these 29 cars were bodied in plastic/fiberglass by Piero Drogo at Carrozzeria Sports Cars in Modena. A3Cs were widely raced. Some cars entered the 1964 and 1965 Le Mans 24 hour, 1965 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 and 1965 Sebring. It achieved a Le Mans class win in both years and a 9th overall in 1965 with no factory support. A3Cs were one of the fastest cars on Le Mans' Mulsanne Straight in both years. Due to the complicated deal with Iso, Bizzarrini left in 1964 and founded Societa Prototipi Bizzarrini (Bizzarrini S.p. A), which produced some 140 cars through 1969 at its Livorno factory. Giotto Bizzarrini was a dedicated race car designer and builder. Likely one of the sources of disagreement between Renzo Rivolta and Giotto Bizzarrini was Bizzarrini\u2019s desire to build race cars and Renzo Rivolta\u2019s desire to build high quality GT cars and family transportation cars. They decided to part ways in 1964. Bizzarrini had mixed success in racing. The lowlight for Bizzarrini must certainly have been the Sebring 12 Hours on March 27, 1965 where both Iso/Bizzarrini race cars were heavily crashed and totaled. The highlight came later that same year at the 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 19\u201320, 1965 where an Iso Grifo/Bizzarrini won the 5000\u00a0cc and over class and was ninth overall. C. Rino Argento helped Bizzarrini manage the race cars during that terrible week in June 1965 at Sebring. He has written a detailed account of that week, which was originally published in the Griffon, the magazine of the Iso & Bizzarrini Owner\u2019s Club.[1] Car No. 8, driven by Silvio Moser, went off track due to brake failure and crashed into a Volkswagen bus. Nobody was injured, but the car was a total loss. Later during a very heavy rain storm car No. 9, driven by Mike Gammino, aquaplaned, hit the pedestrian bridge and split in two. The car split right behind the driver and Mike Gammino did not realize how close he came to being killed until he stepped out of the car. The famous California race car builder Max Balchowsky was also at Sebring helping the Bizzarrini team. He took all of the pieces of these two Iso/Bizzarrini race cars back to his shop in Southern California with the intention to build one Iso/Bizzarrini from the pieces of the two destroyed cars. This recreated Iso/Bizzarrini race car has never been seen again. There was a morbid end to the week: a plane crash killed Iso and Bizzarrini supporter Mitch Michelmore and his son as they were on their way back to California. Michelmore \"had a Chevrolet dealership in Reseda, California and he had sold quite a few Iso Rivoltas; he was enthusiastic about the cars and interested in the racing version (the Grifos) and was seriously considering a sales activity for them in this country\", according to C. Rino Argento. Argento summed up the week: \u201cThis was the end of a terrible week and the pain was unbearable for me, the organizer of this adventure! In great part because of my initiative and planning all these people had congregated at Sebring for what was supposed to be a fun, interesting, successful, and profitable race and it turned out to be a human and material disaster!\u201d[1] In 1966 Bizzarrini S.p.A. released a stunning street legal Grifo A3C as the Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada (or Bizzarrini 5300 GT America, depending on the market). The body shape and mechanical parts were the much the same as the Iso A3Cs, resulting in a power-packed yet sensuous coupe that is 43\" in height.[2] At least three 5300s were turned out as Style Italia-designed spyder/targa versions, all of which survive and are currently owned by the same person.[3] Bizzarrini also managed a scaled-down 5300 GT project. Designed for GM-Opel, it was based on Opel 1900 platform. Bizzarrini's proposal was more aggressive and attractive in appearance, like a small 5300 GT. The production Opel GT was designed by factory stylists and was less aggressive, but still beautiful. Bizzarrini then decided to build the car on his own. Around 17 prototypes were completed. The car is officially named as the Bizzarrini 1900 GT Europa. One of these cars has a barchetta (\"little boat\") body. Some cars are powered by 1300-litre and 1600-litre four-cylinder engines sourced from General Motors, Alfa Romeo and Fiat. There is even a highly developed racing version with a SPICA fuel injection system. Bizzarrini's advanced ideas emerged again with the superb Bizzarrini P538S, P for posteriore, 53 for the 5300 cc Corvette engine, 8 for V8 engine and S for Sportcar. The first V-12 car was ordered by American racer Mike Gammino. This ultra low barchetta raced in the 1966 Le Mans (DNF) and was even entered in 1967, but did not start (DNQ). In 1966, after a spin at the start line, it lasted less than a half an hour and retired due to a cracked oil line. During the short race time, the P538 was clocked as one of the fastest cars on the Mulsanne Straight. In 1968, Giugiaro rebuilt one of the P538 bodies as the famous Bizzarrini Manta. After some years in Sweden, it was dismantled for an extensive restoration. Later featured in various classics car events, it is now in the United States. Seven complete AMX/3 cars and nine chassis are known to survive. Bizzarrini used the 8th AMX/3 chassis to build the Iso Varedo. The 9th chassis was used to build the AMX Spider. This was the ultimate evolution of the P538 and Bizzarrini 5300 GT chassis. Officially, three or four chassis were originally built in period, destined to race in the United States by Mike Gammino and Le Mans. Today, not less than a dozen (or more) chassis are in existence, some of these replicas claiming to be the real cars raced in Le Mans. At least two of the replicas are Lamborghini V12 powered. These V12 powered cars were truly the long-awaited Bizzarrini dream\u00a0\u2014 his own engine and chassis. In 1990, Bizzarrini was involved in the design of a one-off supercar model. Based on Ferrari Testarossa components, Bizzarrini and his team designed a superb car. The Bizzarrini BZ-2001 is the true successor of the P538. The car was the first one of a planned production run, but only one more car was completed. In 1989 a group of young friends living in Ascoli Piceno, with a strong passion for motor sport, had the idea to establish a company constructing \"copies\" of the cars manufactured in the past by Giotto Bizzarrini. During their first encounter, the Tuscan motor genius expressed a kind of animosity towards this idea; he refused to support the project and he turned the group of friends out. Nevertheless, their motivation was so strong that, after a short briefing of about half an hour, they presented an alternative proposal\u00a0\u2014 to construct a sports car. The result was the Picchio Barchetta, powered by BMW engines. The cars were successfully raced in the Italian Hillclimb Championship and Italian Sport Championship. The Kjara project was born in 1998. The Scuderia Bizzarrini built this sport barchetta in close collaboration with Leone Martellucci of University La Sapienza of Roma. The car is powered by a parallel hybrid propulsion system with a 2.5 litre TurboDiesel Lancia engine and a 40\u00a0kW (54\u00a0hp) AC electric drive; it was shown at Turin Auto Show 2000. Mr. Bizzarrini is still busy with personal projects and conferences. At the 2005 Geneva show, the new owner of the marque Bizzarrini showed the new GT Strada 4.1 concept, a two-door GT with a 4.1-litre 550\u00a0bhp (410\u00a0kW; 558\u00a0PS) plant, producing a maximum speed 360\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph), 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h in 3.8\u00a0seconds, and was planned for production in 2007. Since 2008, Giotto Bizzarrini has been working in Livorno, building replicas P538 for American customers. Today, he is still very busy, teaching and collaborating with the Roma University developing advanced projects and designing, building and developing his own sport cars. He often said: \"I'm not a car designer, I am a worker\". On October 23, 2012, the occasion of the inauguration of the University of Florence new Design Campus in Calenzano, Professor Giotto Bizzarrini was given the Honoris Causa Degree in Industrial Design.[4] ",

The core brand is Blumarine, which they started in 1977, followed by Miss Blumarine (1987, 8- to 14-year-old girls), Blugirl (1995, for teenagers) and Anna Molinari (1995),[1] which is being repositioned as their luxury brand.[2] Blumarine was established by Anna Molinari and Gianpaolo Tarabini in 1977, in the town of Carpi in the province of Modena. The name was inspired by the couple's favourite colour and their love of the sea.[1] In 1980 they made their first appearance at Modit in Milan,[1] where Blumarine was named Designer of the Year, which led to their first show at Milan Fashion Week the following year.[1] The 1986 Milan Fashion Week saw the first collection wholly designed by Anna Molinari.[1] As the brand took off and they started to license it to other companies, Blufin was set up in 1988 to act as a holding company.[1] By 2006 royalties accounted for \u20ac5.5m of their income.[2] The first Blumarine boutique was opened in the Via della Spiga, Milan in 1990;[3] the company now sells at more than 1000 retail outlets, of which 55 are own-brand boutiques.[1] In July 2011 the company collection was presented at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.[4] The core brand is Blumarine, which has also been licensed to other companies in the fields of lingerie, accessories, wristwatches,[5][6] homeware and so on; the perfume licence is held by ICR-ITF.[2] In 2007, the company announced that it would be bringing bags and small leather accessories in-house, with a dedicated display area in the Milan shop at Via Montenapoleone 20.[2] A major international expansion of Blumarine boutiques was then also planned, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.[2] The same is true of the Blugirl brand for young women, launched in 1995 and shown in the Milan international fashion shows since 2002.[3] Dedicated boutiques have been opened in Rome, Milan, Naples, Paris, Kiev, Kyoto, Nagoya, Taipei, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and Seoul.[2] Blugirl Folies is a brand launched in the market in 2007, aimed at younger teenage girls, integrating the Blugirl line.[2] In February 2015, the company launched a male fashion line, Blu Sport, at Milan Fashion Week.[7] Anna Molinari has received many awards, of which the most notable are perhaps the Isimbardi Fashion Award in 2001, and a La Kore Fashion Oscar ion 2003. She has also been involved with many charities, such as the Italian Osteoporosis League and the rehabilitation of prisoners. As mentioned above, the couple's daughter Rossella is a designer for the company.  Her brother Gianguido Tarabini joined the company in 1992, became Director of Licensing in 2004, and since the death of his father in 2006 has been the CEO in charge of all the company's commercial affairs and responsible for the Hotel Touring owned directly by his mother, separately from Blufin.[8] ",

It was founded in 1929 by Valentino Bompiani.[1] In 1990, Bompiani became part of the RCS MediaGroup.[2] It was sold in 2015 to the Giunti Group. It is widely regarded as one of the leading literary publishing houses in Italy. Bompiani experienced attempts at book censorship by Italy's fascist government from the 1920s through the 1940s. In 1940, Valentino Bompiani was summoned to Rome to meet with Alessandro Pavolini, the Minister of Popular Culture. At this meeting, Pavolini told Bompiani that he must limit the number of translations that he was publishing. At the time of the meeting, Bompiani was preparing to publish an anthology of American writers. Despite being told not to do so, Bompiani moved forward with the anthology. Pavolini learned of this and wrote to Bompiani that \"The United States is a potential enemy of ours...This is no time to perform acts of courtesy toward America, not even literary ones.\"[3] Bompiani proceeded with publication nonetheless, soliciting a new introduction from Emilio Cecchi that sought to discourage any \"excessive enthusiasm\" toward America. Pavolini was placated by Cecchi's introduction and the anthology was ultimately published.[4][5] In 1972 the company was bought by Fiat Group. In 1990 it became part of RCS MediaGroup. In October 2015, RCS MediaGroup sold RCS Libri, including Bompiani, to Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Italy's largest publisher. Mondadori is owned by Fininvest, a holding company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi. The acquisition was controversial.[6] In March 2016, Italian Competition Authority ruled that Mondadori must sell Bompiani in order to comply with market-share limits.[7] Nine companies, including Amazon and HarperCollins, expressed interest in purchasing Bompiani.[8][9] In September 2016, Bompiani was sold to Giunti Editore for \u20ac16.5 million.[10][11] The list of authors published by Bompiani includes 17 Nobel Prize winners. Authors published by Bompiani include Alberto Moravia, Umberto Eco, Paulo Coelho and Yuval Noah Harari among others. .[1] ",

(established 1922 in Milano) is an Italian manufacturer of wheels, famous for supplying Rudge-Whitworth design single-nut lockable wire wheels to many Italian racing cars and luxury cars until the 1960s. The company was initially named Rudge-Whitworth Milano, as the splined hub locking mechanism was licensed from the Coventry-based Rudge-Whitworth, which had developed the patents since 1908. It was run by Carlo Borrani at Via Ugo Bassi 9, and quickly became supplier for Alfa Romeo, Bianchi, Lancia and other racing cars, used by such drivers as Enzo Ferrari when winning the first Coppa Acerbo in Pescara (1924). Leadership transferred to Cesare Borrani in 1937. It changed its name to Ruote Borrani S.p.A. in the 1930s, when it also began manufacturing aluminum (non-wire) wheels to replace steel wheels.  These bimetal cast-aluminum wheels were standard on Maserati 3500. Between 1946 and 1966, all Ferrari cars were equipped with Borrani wheels as original equipment. The two businesses thus share an important part of Italian automotive history, both on the road and on the race tracks. Afterwards, Borrani wheels remained a major option for Ferrari owners until as late as 1984.  Borrani wheels also were original equipment on famous makes like Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo,  Maserati, Facel Vega and Aston Martin. On relocating, it changed name to Costruzioni Meccaniche Rho S.p.A. (1955), at a time when 1/10 of the annual volume of about 1,500 wheels were for Ferrari racing cars; motorcycles such as Moto-Guzzi were other uses. Prototype cars such as the 1953 Buick Skylark are other examples. In 2004, the Borrani wire wheel production was sold to RuoteMilano srl., member of the international automotive Zeta Europe BV group. The activities were moved to Rozzano on the southern edge of Milan. At these new facilities, the traditional production machines were rebuilt and refurbished to meet modern requirements, and to safeguard the quality and production capacity for Borrani wire wheels. Since then, the total product range has become readily available again and a number of models have been re-entered in production. ",

            "text": " Borsalino is the oldest Italian company specializing in the manufacture of luxury hats. Since 1857, the manufacture has been based in Alessandria, Piedmont. The founder, Giuseppe Borsalino, is remembered for creating a particular model of felt hat that has come to be known eponymously as a \"borsalino\". On 4 April 1857, Giuseppe Borsalino started a workshop in Alessandria that specialized in the production of felt hats. The workshop eventually grew to industrial production, and in 1888 the company moved to a new factory designed by Arnaldo Gardella, located on Corso Cento Cannoni, Alessandria. In these years Borsalino produced 2,500 hats a day, but when the company won the Grand Prix, an important quality certificate, at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, spread the brand's fame globally. The succession of Giuseppe Borsalino was complicated: the designated heir, Teresio Borsalino, was opposed to his cousin Giovanni Borsalino, son of Lazzaro, who inaugurated a new hat factory using the family name. Between Borsalino Antica Casa and Borsalino Fu Lazzaro were years of hard commercial battles but in the end the Teresio came out and the name Borsalino became one again.  On the eve of the First World War Borsalino produced about 2,000,000 hats annually. The manufacture employed over 2,500 employees, representing a significant resource in the economy of the Piedmontese city. Abroad, the brand spread everywhere, conquering the most important markets: the British, but especially the US, where the hats produced in Alessandria were adopted by the Hollywood starsystem.  The downsizing of the company occurred in 1950 in conjunction with the beginning of the fall into disuse of formal hats: Borsalino is thus transformed from mass product into a cult object. In 1987 the hat factory moved from the historic center in Alessandria to the current one of Spinetta Marengo, in the suburbs of the city, and the president Vittorio Vaccarino, the last descendant of the Borsalino family, sold the company to a group of Milanese entrepreneurs.  In the nineties the company changed ownership several times to be finally bought by the entrepreneur Marco Marenco, involved in a \u20ac3.5 billion financial crack.  On 18 December 2017 the Court of Alessandria declared the bankruptcy of Borsalino Giuseppe and Fratello Spa[1][2]. Haeres Equita, a private equity fund which manages the brand's activities since 2016, confirms the will to continue the production, the distribution and the promoting activities of the forthcoming collections, keeping all employments and maintaining the production site in Alessandria (Piedmont)[3]. In 2017, on the occasion of the 160th anniversary of the company, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development recognized Borsalino as one of the 'Excellencies of the production system', dedicating it a stamp worth \u20ac0.95[4]. On 12 July 2018, the company was sold in a court auction for 6.4 million euros ($7.4 million) to Haeres Equita.[5]  Borsalino manufacturing has remained faithful to a production process that represents the cultural values of the company, handed down from generation to generation.  The hats continue to be produced in Alessandria by combining industrial technology and the spirit craftsmanship. The felt models, created from fur fibers, require more than 50 manual steps and seven weeks of work to create; the straw models, which are hand twisted, can take up to 6 months for a single hat[6][7][8]. The Borsalino business dynasty has made an important contribution to the city of Alessandria, building the aqueduct, the sewerage network, hospital, sanatorium and retirement home[9]. The historic headquarters of the company, currently located in Corso 100 Cannoni, now hosts the University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro and the Borsalino Hat Museum[10][11][12][13].  In 2016, independent film director Enrica Viola dedicated a documentary to the relationship between Borsalino and Alessandria: Borsalino City[14][15][16] was presented at film festivals in Turin, Barcelona and Melbourne. In the spring of 2006, the Borsalino Hat Museum opened in the company's historical headquarters in Corso 100 Cannoni, Alessandria. A joint initiative by Alessandria town council and the Borsalino company, the museum covers an exhibition area of 400 m\u00b2 and houses about two thousand hats, displayed in the historic Chippendale style cabinets made in the 1920s by Arnaldo Gardella for the factory sample room. In 2018, the museum is planning to move to a larger venue with a completely renovated exhibition[17]. Among Orthodox Jewish men and boys, covering the head is an identifier of religiousity.[18] Many men in strictly Orthodox Jewish communities wear a black, wide-brimmed Borsalino hat. This preference is so common that black hats of this style by other makers are called borsalino as a generic trademark.[19][20] The relationship between Borsalino and the art world has ancient origins. Since the birth of advertising in Italy, at the turn of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Borsalino has entrusted the realization of its posters to the most important artists of the time. This privileged relationship with art has been confirmed over time and has led the company to collaborate with Cesare Simonetti, Giorgio Muggiani, Giovanni Dradi, Franz Laskoff, Marcello Dudovich, winner in 1910 of a competition organized by Borsalino to publicize the Zenit hat, Giuseppe Minonzio, Gino Boccasile, Luigi Bompard, Jeanne Grignani, Luigi Veronesi, Max Huber and Armando Testa. Today the antique Borsalino advertising posters are collector items that have been beaten in the most important auction houses in the world. In Arthur Miller\u2019s play The Price, character Solomon regrets that his hat is not a Borsalino, in spite of looking so. Borsalino has a long-running and special bond with the film industry. One picture stands out above all: Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the unforgettable final scene of Casablanca. The relationship with the cinema was destined to last: in addition to Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, Marcello Mastroianni in 8 \u00bd and Jean Paul Belmondo in Breathless both wore a Borsalino.  Above all, the Alessandria factory granted the use of its name to two cult films of the 1970s: Borsalino and Borsalino & Co.. The idea was Alain Delon's, and Borsalino accepted on the condition that the company logo would appear on the posters. The Italian company was the first luxury brand to give its name to two films.  In 2011, the Triennale Design Museum in Milan hosted an exhibition entitled \"Il cinema con il cappello. Borsalino e altre storie\"[21][22][23]. The actor Toni Servillo wears a Borsalino in the film The Great Beauty, which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards. In 2009, Borsalino was included by the Triennale Design Museum in Milan among quintessential Italian icons in the 'Serie Fuori Serie' exhibition[24]. The exhibition was replicated in March 2017 at the National Museum of China in Beijing[25].  The Chapeau Lamp[26] (2014) designed by Philippe Starck for Flos and the sculpture The Hatband[27](2016) by Moritz Waldemeyer are both tributes to Borsalino. Borsalino has been collaborating with some of the most important names in the fashion system since the beginning of the millennium. These have led to the creation of capsule collections with Nick Fouquet[28], Tom Ford, Moschino, Yohji Yamamoto, Marni, Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9, Rochas, Italia Independent and DSquared. ",

Carla sketched the designs and her husband made the bags and handled the business. The first bag was made with leather and straw, a unique choice at that time. She trained her team to learn the craft and sew. The bags had a playful mood combined with unique designs and new materials.[6] A flood in 1966 in Florence destroyed all the fabrics and the archives and Carla with her team had to start all over.[6] In the 1980s, two of the Carla\u2019s three sons Riccardo and Massimo joined the company and adopted her philosophy and carried forth her vision.[7] In 1987 the company entered into many licensing agreements with companies like Vivienne Westwood for the production and distribution of accessories; bags, belts and small leather items. The following year in 1988 Contromano was founded a partner company and over the course of a few years Braccialini entered into licensee agreements with  brands like RoccoBarocco, Fiorucci, Bagutta[8] In 1990, Braccialini launched the Tua collection targeted at a younger audience.[9] Also the first Braccialini boutique was opened in Florence. 2000's was a period of growth for the brand. Braccialini collaborated with the Mariella Burani Fashion Group. Braccialini opened stores in Milan,.[10] In 2003 a new mono brand store opens in Milan followed by boutiques in Rome, London Dubai in 2004. Also, a licensee agreement with Mariella Burani is established to produce and distribute accessories for them all over the world. In 2005, the first franchisee store in Saudi Arabia and two boutiques in Dubai and Hong Kong are opened. The company acquires 100% stake in Dadorosa Srl, with worldwide licensee of Gherardini, in 2007 a Florentine brand. The expansion of the brand continues with new stores in Dubai, Paris and Moscow. Braccialini also enters into more licensing agreements with Frangi Spa controlling the production of foulards, scarves, beachwear and lingerie.[9] In 2009, Braccialini moved to the new headquarters in Scandicci, Florence. The Feng Shui inspired factory is designed by Chan tit-Kwan from Hong Kong. The new building spreads across 10,000 square meters of space in heart of the leather manufacturing sector of Florence. The external fa\u00e7ade which is covered by vertical plants and ivy and the internal layout is constructed on the basis of Feng Shui principles. The factory also uses renewable sources of energy like solar panels and recovery of rain water.[11] Today, the company is led by her three sons \u2013 Riccardo, Massimo and Lorenzo who have taken on three different roles in the company. Massimo is the style director, Riccardo the CEO and Lorenzo the marketing and communication director. The creative team of designers led by Carla and her son Massimo create handbags and accessories.[8] In October 2012 Braccialini announced up to 77 layoffs of 220 employees total but in 2013, after an agreement with the unions, only 25 people will leave the Company, due to the externalization of logistics.[clarification needed] ",

An international leader in diagnostic imaging, in Italy Bracco is also a well-known brand associated with a number of historic pharmaceutical products such as Cebion, Xamamina, Euclorina, the Alfa eye-drops line and the Friliver range of sport supplements. The Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is Diana Bracco. A Chemistry graduate from the University of Pavia, Diana Bracco is also Chairman of Expo 2015 Spa, General Section Commissioner for the Italy Pavilion at Expo and Confindustria Vice President for Research & Innovation. Decorated as a Cavaliere del Lavoro, she was President of Assolombarda and, before that, Chairman of Federchimica. In February 2001 she received an Honorary Doctor of Pharmacy degree from University of Pavia. On January 12 2015, Diana Bracco was \"prosecuted on charges of tax evasion and embezzlement, crimes allegedly committed as chairman of the board of the pharmaceutical group Bracco Spa.\"[4][5][6][7] In October 2016, she was given a two year suspended sentence for tax fraud and embezzlement.[8] The company founded by Elio Bracco was established in 1927 in Milan with the name Societ\u00e0 Italiana Prodotti E Merck, to produce, package and sell the chemical products of the German company E. Merck. It had just five employees. In 1934 Fulvio Bracco, Elio\u2019s son, officially joined the company which, the same year, began marketing Cebion, an innovative product based on vitamin C, recently discovered by Hungarian professor Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi. In 1962 Bracco researchers created the first contrast agent based on their original research: iodamide, a product with very high tolerability. On 17 March 1977 Diana Bracco, Fulvio\u2019s daughter, was appointed Bracco General Manager. In 1981 the company launched Iopamidol in Italy and Germany, a product with outstanding tolerability, whose stability allowed it to be stored in phials for unlimited periods of time. In the second half of the 1980s, Bracco Spa became the leading international producer of non-ionic contrast agents. It also won a positive response and important results for other formulations, including the anti-tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide, of which Bracco is the leading world producer, which is included in the WHO list of essential pharmaceuticals. In 1990, Bracco began a ten-year period of important growth. At international level, acquisitions and joint ventures enhanced the Group structure. In 1990 the Bracco Eisai joint venture was set up in Japan. In 1994 Bracco acquired Squibb Diagnostic, a company in the Bristol Myers Squibb group in the United States, which is still Bracco Imaging\u2019s largest market today. 1995 saw the integration of the three research centres in Milan, Geneva and Princeton: Milan focuses on the research and development of contrast agents for radiology and magnetic resonance, Bracco Research Geneva on ultrasound and Bracco Research USA Princeton on magnetic resonance and nuclear medicine. 1999 was a milestone year for the company: the Bracco family and the Merck Group reached an agreement under which Bracco bought Merck\u2019s 50% stake in the Group\u2019s diagnostic and pharmaceuticals operations. In 2001, the Bracco Group acquired ACIST Medical Systems, a US company based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, active in advanced contrast-agent management and injection systems. Meanwhile, the Group\u2019s international growth continued, with more offices opening around the world. Since 2002 Bracco has had a direct presence in China with Bracco Sine Pharmaceutical Corp. Ltd. in Shanghai. In 2008 it acquired E-Z-EM, a leading company in the radiology sector. In 2010 Bracco entered Estonia, Scandinavia and South Korea. In 2011 Bracco Imaging acquired Swiss Medical Care (now Bracco Injeneering) and the Nycomed production plants in Singen (Germany). In 2012 it completed the acquisitions of Justesa in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. ",

The firm was founded by Ernesto Breda in Milan in 1886. It originally manufactured locomotives and other railway machinery, but later branched out into armaments and aircraft. Occasionally, not continuously, the company also built trolleybuses.  In 1935, it acquired the railway division of Officine Ferroviarie Meridionali and, soon afterwards, the aircraft division of the same company. In 1962, Breda was nationalised as part of EFIM, but was liquidated in the 1990s. The train and tram manufacturing division fused with Ansaldo to form AnsaldoBreda, the armaments division became an independent entity as Breda Meccanica Bresciana, as did the research division as Istituto Scientifico Breda. The production of trolleybuses was a small part of Breda's output, carried out through its subsidiary Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (it), and was not under way continuously.  Between 1936 and 1940, the company built a total of 28 trolleybuses, most for the Rome system but including six for Genoa.[2] At various times between 1938 and 1956, more trolleybuses were built, but totalling only 16.  Production resumed in 1988.  Almost all of Breda's customers for trolleybuses were Italian trolleybus systems, but a notable exception was an order of 236 dual-mode buses that Breda built for the Seattle system between 1988 and 1991.[2] ",

Founded in Rome in 1945,[1] it is known for its made-to-measure men's suits, sartorial ready-to-wear collections and leather goods. Throughout its history, the company has invented concepts such as the men's runway show, the trunk show, and the ready-to-wear Haute Couture. It has  been a point of reference for the entertainment, institutional and business worlds. Its Creative Director  from July 2012 to February 2016 was British-born Brendan Mullane.[2][3][4] Its creative director from April 2016 to September 2016 was Justin O\u2019Shea.[5][6][7] As of June 15, 2017, Nina-Maria Nitsche is Brioni's Creative Director.[8][9][10][11][12] Brioni was established in Rome in 1945 as a men's tailoring company by founders Nazareno Fonticoli, a tailor, and Gaetano Savini, an entrepreneur.[13] They opened their first shop on Via Barberini 79, naming the brand after the formerly Italian Brionian Islands (now part of Croatia); the shop is still at the same address. Brioni quickly started to raise interest from high-profile movie business personalities, heads of state and business leaders. In 1952, Brioni staged the first men\u2019s fashion show in history, inside the Sala Bianca at Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The clothes introduced new silhouettes, bold colors and innovative fabrics, marking an important chapter for the company. A couple of years later, Brioni invented the trunk show, during which the collections were presented directly in stores, allowing customers to personalize the garments with the Su Misura service (made-to-measure).[14] In 1959, a production plant was opened in Penne, Abruzzo, birth town of Nazareno Fonticoli. Called Brioni Roman Style, the state-of-the-art factory introduced the concept of Pr\u00eat Couture, or ready-to-wear Haute Couture that sealed the international rise of the brand. In 1985, the company opened a tailoring school in Penne with the aim of transmitting to younger generations the specific Brioni sartorial method.[15] In 2007[16] and 2011[17] The Luxury Institute   ranked Brioni among the most prestigious men\u2019s fashion luxury goods brands in America. In 2012, with the acquisition by French group Kering,[18] the company entered a new phase. Under the leadership of Creative Director Brendan Mullane, Brioni designs, develops and manufactures Su Misura garments and sartorial ready-to-wear collections as well as leather goods, shoes, eyewear and fragrance. Brioni products are distributed globally, encompassing Europe, Asia and America, through directly-owned boutiques and a network of department stores. On March 23, 2016, luxury conglomerate Kering announced that it had appointed Justin O\u2019Shea, a heavily tattooed Australian and street-style enthusiast with more than 80,000 Instagram followers, as  creative director.[19] A self-taught retail expert, O\u2019Shea was formerly the fashion director of the German e-commerce site MyTheresa.[20][21] O\u2019Shea featured the four members of Metallica dressed in Brioni tuxedos in his first ad campaign with the brand;[22][23] the photos were shot by  Zackery Michael.[24] The remake of Brioni's logo under O'Shea by friend and frequent collaborator Benny Robinson has been compared to the Fraktur typeface.[25][26] O'Shea showed his  first collection for the house on 4 July 2016.[27] In early October 2016 Brioni announced that O'Shea would leave the brand.[28][29] Brioni reported that its  Autumn/Winter 2017 collection would be presented to buyers in the Milan showroom from mid-November 2016 but would not have a corresponding runway show.[28] On 17 March 2017 announced the appointment of Fabrizio Malverdi as CEO,[30][31] a month after  Gianluca Flore stepped down from the role.[32][33] As of 2015, Brioni had 46 directly-operated retail stores.[34] Brioni has stores in:[35] ",

The company was founded in 1945 by Giuseppe Brion and Leone Pajetta. Initially called B.P.M. Company[1] and manufacturing electronic components, the business became known as Brionvega in 1960. In the early 1960s, two unusually designed portable television sets, designed by Marco Zanuso and Richard Sapper, were launched by Brionvega by the names \"Doney\" (1962) and \"Algol\" (1964). In 1969, Brionvega released the \"Cubo\" television.  This set was designed by Mario Bellini and became a classic of that era and is on permanent display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  An updated version of this television was produced in 1992[2]  with the same exterior casing but new electronics but this is now out of production. In 1993, Gian Mario Rossignolo bought Brionvega from the Brion family and placed it into his S\u00e8leco company (which later became Seleco-Formenti). Seleco developed financial  problems when Turkish electronics producers caused prices to fall rapidly and by April 1997 Seleco-Formenti was declared bankrupt. Almost 10 years later, the Brionvega brand came back to life when it was bought twice - the rights for the production of radios and audio systems was bought by Sim2 Multimedia whilst in August 2006 the rights for the Brionvega brand plus the TV designs and production was taken over by the Super//Fluo company. Since the take over of the brand, Super//Fluo has re-issued two of the original products in limited edition runs, the Doney TV  and the Algol TV .[3] The also introduced a new design LCD Television, the Alpha, presented at Salone del Mobile in 2007.

The trio began to accept contract work until the first Magli Shoe Factory (Calzaturificio Magli) was established later that same year. Shortly after World War Two in 1947, the company built their first manufacturing facility. The brand used the opportunity to expand their line of shoe products. In 1969, the company moved to a larger, more modern factory in Bologna, which it continues to occupy today. From the 1980s onwards, the Magli company opened over forty retail stores located throughout America, Australia, China and Europe. In 2001, the Luxembourg-based investment fund Opera, half owned by Bulgari, acquired a controlling interest in Bruno Magli. In 2007 Opera sold the brand to UK private equity fund Fortelus Capital, and in 2014, the Swiss fund Da Vinci Invest acquired the brand. In January 2015, Marquee Brands announced its acquisition of the Bruno Magli brand and related intellectual property assets from Bruno Magli S.p.A. Marquee Brands, a brand acquisition, licensing and development company, was launched by the private equity group Neuberger Berman in September 2014. The luxury brand corporate office is now headquartered out of Marquee's New York City offices but its products will continue to be designed and produced in Italy.  ",

While the majority of design, production and marketing is overseen and executed by Bulgari, the company does, at times, partner with other entities. For example, Bulgari eyewear is produced through a licensing agreement with Luxottica, and Bulgari formed a joint venture with Marriott International in 2001 to launch its hotel brand, Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, a collection of properties and resort destinations around the world. Currently part of the LVMH Group, Bulgari was founded in the region of Epirus, Greece, in 1884 by the silversmith Sotirios Boulgaris (Italian: Sotirio Bulgari) as a single jewellery shop that has, over the years, become an international brand. The company has evolved into a player in the luxury market, with an established and growing network of stores.[2] The trademark is usually written BVLGARI in the classical Latin alphabet, and it is derived from the surname of the company's founder, Sotirios Voulgaris (1857\u20131932; Greek: \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2, pronounced\u00a0[so\u02c8tir\u029dos \u02c8boulgaris]).[3] The BVLGARI logo was used for the first time in 1934, when its gilded brass letters graced the central doorway of the Via Condotti flagship store.[4] In reference to ancient Rome, the \u201cU\u201d was replaced with the letter \u201cV\u201d, and a logo was born. Since then, the trademark is written BVLGARI in the classical Latin alphabet.[3][5] The Voulgaris were a silversmithing family from the Epirus region of [Greece]]. Whether or not the Voulgaris family of Corfu and the Voulgaris family of the Italian jewelers Bulgari from Epirus share the same paternal line is unclear, but the count Stefanos Voulgaris denied that the Bulgari family of the Italian jewelers family is genealogically related to the Voulgaris family of Corfu.[6] According to chronicles of the Voulgaris family written in Venetian Corfu, the \"Voulgaris family of Saint Spyridon of Corfu\" descend from the royal figures of barbarian peoples from the Volga river, who \"finally settled in Moesia near the Haemus mountains, located in Bulgaria\", so the founding father of this family was described as the \"Triballian\" (de facto Serbian) Prince Stefan Lazarevic in the 16th century testemant of the family, becoming such by taking refugee in the Venetian island Corfu.[7][8][6] The founder of the Bulgari brand is Sotirios Voulgaris (Greek: \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2, pronounced\u00a0[so\u02c8tir\u029dos \u02c8vul\u0263aris]) who was born in  March 1857 and came from the Epirus Village of Paramythia, the largest Aromanian center of silversmithing in the Balkans.[9] He was one of eleven children of his father Georgios Voulgaris(1823-1889) and his Aromanian mother Eleni Stronggaris.[9] In 1881, Sotirios Bulgari moved to Rome and, in 1884, opened his first store on via Sistina 85. In 1888, he married Aromanian Eleni Basio with whom he had six children: Constantine-Georgios(1889-1973), Leonidas-Georgios(1890-1966), Maria-Athena(1891-1976), Sofia(1893-1908), Alexandra(1895-1984) and Spyridon(1897-1932); Leonidas-Georgios is the father of the current chairman of the company, Paolo Bulgari.[9] In 1905, he unveiled the Via Condotti shop that would become the company\u2019s flagship.[10] In its early years, Bulgari was known for silver pieces that borrowed elements from Byzantine and Islamic art, combining them with floral motifs. At the time, Paris was the apex of fashion and creativity, and its trends influenced Sotirio\u2019s designs for decades: jewels of the early 20s were characterised by platinum Art Deco settings while those of the 30s featured geometric diamond motifs\u2014sometimes set in combination with coloured gemstones. Convertible jewels were also popular during the time, and one of Bulgari\u2019s major piece was the Trombino, a small trumpet-shaped ring. In 1932 Sotirio died, leaving the business to his two sons, Giorgio (1890\u20131966) and Costantino (1889\u20131973), who each had a keen interest in precious stones and jewels. During the Second World War, most new jewellery was crafted out of gold, as gems were scarce, and designs became more natural feeling. As the 1940s came to a close, Bulgari introduced Serpenti bracelet-watches.[11] In the 50s some of Bulgari best-known clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Anna Magnani, Ingrid Bergman and Gina Lollobrigida[12] as Rome earned a reputation as \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" with the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios.  At the same time, Bulgari went to a new style. The post-war boom saw a return to precious materials, particularly white metals covered in diamonds. In the 50s, Bulgari launched its first floral brooches\u2014called en tremblant because of their trembling diamond corollas. At the end of the 50s, Bulgari began to establish its motifs, introducing structured, symmetrical shapes in yellow gold set with brilliant gems\u2014chosen for their colour rather than intrinsic value. Among these multi-hued jewels, cabochon cuts were another innovation. These new pieces were a significant departure from classical Parisian design.After Giorgio's death in 1966, his son Gianni led the company as co-chief executive with his cousin Marina.[13] During the 1970s, Bulgari stores opened in New York, Geneva, Monte Carlo and Paris. This era marks the beginning of the Group\u2019s international expansion, with Gianni as chairman and CEO. A number of new motifs made their debut as well\u2014jewels became recognisable for their angular forms, strong colours, oval elements with cabochons, chains and maxi sautoirs, whilst the predominant use of yellow gold made precious pieces feel all the more wearable, and became known as a Bulgari trademark.[citation needed] In 1977, Bulgari entered the world of horlogerie with the launch of the BVLGARI BVLGARI watch.[14] At the time, Gianni led a complete overhaul of the company, focusing on product design.[15] In the early 80s, to oversee all production of Bulgari watches, Bulgari Time was founded in Switzerland.[16] In 1984, Paolo and Nicola Bulgari, Giorgio\u2019s sons, became Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively,[17] while their nephew, Francesco Trapani, became Chief Executive Officer.[18] In 1985, Gianni resigned as CEO and in 1987, he left the family business after selling his one-third stake in the company to his brothers Nicola and Paolo. Bulgari diversified its brand in 1993 with the launch of its first fragrance, Eau Parfum\u00e9e au The Vert and the founding of Bulgari Parfums in Switzerland to oversee the creation and production of all perfumes. In 1995, Bulgari pushed ahead with an aggressive programme for growth, becoming listed on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time. In 1996, the brand launched its first accessories collection, beginning with silk scarves before developing a range of leather accessories and eyewear. In 1999, the brand launched the B.zero1 ring.[clarification needed][18] The company has seen 150% revenue growth between 1997 and 2003. Bvlgari continues to build up many brands which has made them one of the most profitable luxury brands in the jewelry industry. The year 2000 was the beginning of an increasingly aggressive period of verticalization for Bulgari, with the acquisition of the luxury watchmaking brands Daniel Roth and G\u00e9rald Genta,[19] followed by the takeover of the jewellery firm Crova and of other companies that specialised in leather goods and watchmaking.[20] The opening of the first Bulgari Hotel in Milan in 2004 further confirmed the expansion strategy of the brand, and was the result of a joint venture with Luxury Group, a division of Marriot International. In 2009, Bulgari celebrated its 125th anniversary with a retrospective of the brand\u2019s history, held in Rome at Palazzo delle Esposizioni.[21] That same year, the snake\u2014a motif that appeared in Bulgari collections from the 1960s\u2014re-emerged as the emblem of the Serpenti collection. In 2011, Bulgari signed a strategic alliance with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world\u2019s leading luxury group. The agreement was based on a stock transfer of the Bulgari family's shares in Bulgari S.p.A. to LVMH, an all-share deal for \u20ac4.3\u00a0billion ($6.01\u00a0billion), higher than LVMH had offered for any other company.[22] Under the deal, the Bulgari family sold their 50.4 per cent controlling stake in exchange for 3 per cent of LVMH, thereby becoming the second-biggest family shareholder behind the Arnaults in LVMH.[23] The takeover doubled the size of LVMH\u2019s watches and jewellery unit, which at the time of the acquisition included Tag Heuer timepieces and De Beers diamond necklaces. The acquisition concluded on 4 October 2011 as Bulgari was delisted from the Borsa Italiana.[citation needed] In 2014, Bulgari celebrated the 130th anniversary of the brand. To mark the occasion, the shop at Via Condotti 10 was \"reimagined\" by the architect Peter Marino, and reopened. On the same day, the brand donated \u20ac1.5 million to the city of Rome for the restoration of the Spanish Steps.[24] A few months after the Grand Opening, the DOMVS was inaugurated in the redesigned Bulgari boutique, creating a gallery space to house of Bulgari\u2019s Heritage Collection.[25] In 2017 Bulgari opened a new jewellery manufacturing headquarters in Valenza. The largest in Europe, with a total area of 14,000sqm, the Manufacture has been given a Gold LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) certification for sustainability in its design.[26] The facility was built over the former home of the first goldsmith in Valenza, Francesco Caramora. The buildings follow the model of a Roman domus, and are built around a central courtyard.[27] Bulgari\u2019s jewellery collections include B.zero1, Divas\u2019 Dream, Serpenti, BVLGARI BVLGARI, Parentesi, and a bridal line.[citation needed] Bulgari\u2019s watches collections include Octo, BVLGARI BVLGARI, Diagono and Haute Horlogerie creations for men, and LVCEA, Serpenti, Divas\u2019 Dream, BVLGARI BVLGARI, B.zero1 and High Jewellery timepieces for women. It mixes Italian design and Swiss watchmaking. The company's Swiss subsidiary, Bulgari Haute Horlogerie SA, is responsible for Bulgari watch production. It was founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Neuch\u00e2tel. Bulgari Haute Horlogerie SA employs about 500 people.[citation needed] Bulgari\u2019s fragrance assortment includes Goldea, Splendida and Omnia for women, BVLGARI Man, Aqua, the Classics, and Blv Pour Homme for men, whilst BVLGARI Le Gemme and Eau Parfum\u00e9e. The creation of Bulgari accessories and leather goods is handled in the Bulgari atelier in Florence. Twice a year, Bulgari presents its latest collections at Milan Fashion Week, debuting them at the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter shows. In 2001 Bulgari S.p.A. formed a joint venture with \"Luxury Group\", the Luxury Division of Marriott International, to launch Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, a collection of hotels  and resort destinations around the world.[citation needed] Their distinctive settings and Italian design by the architectural firm Antonio Citterio-Patricia Viel characterise the properties of Bulgari Hotel Group. Having grown from a curated collection of three\u2014Milan (opened in 2004), Bali (2006) and London (2012)\u2014the Bulgari Hotels & Resorts portfolio has recently added Beijing (2017), Dubai (2017) and Shanghai (2018) properties. There are three additional Hotels in the works, with Moscow, Paris and Tokyo slated to open between 2020 and 2022.[28] As of December 31, 2018, it has 6 hotels with 523 rooms.[29] Bulgari relies on a distribution network of about 300 stores. The largest Bulgari store in the world is the 10-story Bulgari Ginza Tower in Tokyo, 940 square meters of retail floor space, including a restaurant and lounge bar.[citation needed] North American Bulgari boutiques and distributors are found in Aspen, Atlanta, Beverly Hills, Bal Harbour, Boca Raton, Bethesda (Chevy Chase), Charlotte, Chicago, Costa Mesa, Dallas, Honolulu, Houston, King of Prussia, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Cabo San Lucas. Mx, Montreal, Palm Beach, San Francisco, Short Hills, Scottsdale, Arizona, and Toronto.[citation needed] South American Bulgari distributors are found in Lima, Bogot\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo, Margarita island & Quito.[citation needed] In 2009, Bulgari took action on behalf of disadvantaged children around the world through a partnership with Save the Children. The brand started a campaign which included the launch of a Save the Children custom-designed jewellery collection,[30] of which a portion of the proceeds went to the charity. As of 2018, Bulgari's contribution has totalled 80 million dollars. The Bulgari Art Award is an annual art award in partnership with the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.[31] Sponsored by Bulgari the $50,000 acquisitive cash award plus $30,000 residency in Italy is presented to mid-career Australian artists. The inaugural prize winner in 2012 was Michael Zavros.

Today it has subsidiaries, interests and operations in Italy, Luxembourg, Germany, Algeria and Eastern Europe as well as in North America.[5][failed verification] The company was formed in September 1999 when Buzzi Cementi (founded as Fratelli Buzzi SpA in Trino Vercellese by the brothers Pietro and Antonio Buzzi in 1907) took over Unicem (founded as Cementi Marchino in Casale by Luigi Marchino in 1878), and took on the name Buzzi Unicem.  The company is founded by a large family connected to the successful Italian fencer, Lorenzo Buzzi[6].  In 2004 the group acquired control of the German cement company Dyckerhoff (founded as Portland-Cement-Fabrik Dyckerhoff & S\u00f6hne in Am\u00f6neburg by Wilhelm Gustav Dyckerhoff and his sons in 1864).  In March 2018, Buzzi Unicem acquired the German firm Portlandzementwerke Seibel & S\u00f6hne through the Dyckerhoff subsidiary.[7] In September 2018, Buzzi Unicem revealed that it had acquired 50% of Brazil's BCPAR (owned by Grupo Ricardo Brannand), which includes two cement plants in the country, with an option to acquire the rest of the firm by 2025.[8]  This acquisition was made at a relatively low cost, likely at a loss for the seller, due to the precarious financial situation facing the Brazilian construction industry at the time.[8]  In November 2018, Buzzi Unicem was one of thirty companies that formed the advocacy group Global Cement and Concrete Association, as a partial replacement for the Cement Sustainability Initiative.[9] As of 2018,[update] the company had sales in, at least, the Czech Republic, Germany (through Dyckerhoff),[7] Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russia,[10] Slovakia, Ukraine, and the United States (through Buzzi Unicem USA)[11].[12] The current Chairman is Sandro Buzzi; Chief Executives are Pietro Buzzi (Corporate Finance) and Michele Buzzi (Operations management). Buzzi Unicem was among several cement companies who in mid-2018 were fined tens-of-millions of Euros for cartel-like behavior in Italy, fines initially imposed in 2017 by the Italian Competition Authority and subsequently appealed.[13] In September 2017, the company bought a 50% stake in Ecotrade, a supplier of industrial byproducts (e.g. fly ash, slags), with the intent to expand it's internal operations.[14] In mid-2017, Buzzi Unicem suffered a cyberattack which disrupted its internal process administration and delayed financial disclosures, thought to be due to the Petya ransomware virus likely infiltrating through plants that it operates in the Ukraine.[15]  ",

For this reason Alitalia when merged with Air One didn't close C.A.I. at that time known as Volare S.p.A. and then Volareweb.com. It used to be a low cost subsidiary of the old Alitalia-LAI. Its head office was located in Area Tecnica Sud of Terminal 1 of Milan-Malpensa International Airport, in Ferno, Varese, Italy,[3] and it ceased activity with this name on 12 January 2009. The airline was then used to operate Alitalia flights from Linate Airport as C.A.I. Second. This name was only a legal one and not used in public, all of its flights were branded as Alitalia. The airline ceased operations and was merged into Alitalia mainline by February 2015.[2] At one time the airline (Volare Group) operated flights from Italy to Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Romania and London Luton Airport. The airline suspended its operations in November 2004 and filed for bankruptcy. The tickets on suspended flights were never refunded to passengers. Since then, the airline exited bankruptcy and, for a period, only operated Italian domestic routes. By May 2008, Volare flew to 20 destinations in Europe. Volare's charter and leisure subsidiary Air Europe flew to other long-haul destinations. With the fusion of Alitalia-CAI and Air One later on that year, however, Air Europe was discontinued.[4] After bankruptcy, the Volare Group was put up for sale by the Italian Government in December 2004. Alitalia-LAI's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid,[5] however Air One tried to block the sale by going to court. On 14 April 2006 Volare S.p.A was founded.[6] On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary). Volare Group had its head office in Thiene, Italy and its commercial management and charter management in Milan.[7] Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare S.p.A. In Italy, the sale of Volare is considered a soap-opera due to the multiple obstacles placed on the sale of the airline to Alitalia-LAI. As of 1 January 2008, Volareweb was an integral part of Alitalia-LAI and was serving as the company's Italian low-cost subsidiary. Furthermore, due to Alitalia-LAI's hub switch from Milan-Malpensa to Rome-Fiumicino, several flights from Malpensa were discontinued (such as Krak\u00f3w and Timi\u015foara) and transferred to Volare. With the Alitalia-CAI-Air One fusion, these flights ceased to exist. Nowadays from Milan Malpensa Alitalia-CAI has adopted Air One as a subsidiary for low-fare flights.[8] Only one Airbus A320 coming from parent Alitalia-CAI, remained in the fleet (EI-IKB) to preserve the slots. On 11 February 2015, the airline was dissolved and its operations integrated into Alitalia mainline.[2][9] Volare Airlines code VE was used on some Alitalia flights from Milan Linate Airport (in this way, Alitalia can operate more flights than it would have been able to using a single airline, as there is a limit to the operations at Linate airport for airlines). C.A.I. First was used for the same purpose. Volareweb.com, the low-cost subsidiary of Alitalia-LAI, served these destinations at the time of closure: Prior to its shutdown in February 2015, the fleet consisted of the following aircraft: Volareweb.com operated the following aircraft throughout operations:[10] The last two Volareweb.com A320's were repainted in March 2010 into the Air One livery and are being used alongside 3 others for Air One's \"low fare\" model operations.

The name is a portmanteau derived from the founder's name 'Giovanni Castiglioni' and the founding location, i.e. CAstiglioni GIovanni VArese. In its history, Cagiva won races in Dakar and Motocross competitions, as well as in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. In 1978 Cagiva entered the motorcycle business with two racing motorcycles ridden by Gianfranco Bonera and Marco Lucchinelli. In the same year it bought a factory in Varese's frazione of Schiranna from Aermacchi/AMF-Harley-Davidson and went into motorcycle production. By 1979 the company reached an annual production of 40,000 motorbikes, with eight models powered by two-stroke engines ranging from 125\u00a0cc to 350\u00a0cc. Many of the Harley-Davidson models were continued in production as Cagivas, and the off-road motorcycle division was improved and expanded, eventually producing its own race-winning WMX series of moto-cross motorcycles. In 1983 Cagiva also sourced Ducati four stroke v-twin engines from 350\u00a0cc to 1000\u00a0cc and entered the big displacement market. Cagiva bought Ducati in 1985, but kept the Ducati brand that was better recognized outside Italy. Ducati motorcycle production continued in Bologna, while the Varese-built Cagiva Ala Azzurra (sold under the name \"Alazzurra\", \"Bluewing\") and Elefant were introduced, both featuring Ducati engines.[2] Cagiva continued with strategic buyouts of Moto Morini in 1985 and Husqvarna in 1987. In 1991 Cagiva also bought the trademarks for the MV Agusta brand. In 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer by the Texas Pacific Group and sold the Ducati and Moto Morini brands. In 1999, for strategic purposes, the company was restructured. MV Agusta Motor become the main brand comprising Cagiva and Husqvarna.[3] In 2000, production of the Cagiva roadster ended. In 2008, Harley-Davidson bought MV Agusta Motor, the parent company of Cagiva, thereby regaining some control of its old Aermacchi factory. In October 2009, Harley-Davidson informed that it would put Cagiva up for sale. In the August of the following year, Cagiva was bought back by the son of the founder and former owner Claudio Castiglioni. In 2012, production of new high engine capacity Mitos ended. Increasingly stringent environmental emission requirements and the concentration of resources on MV Agusta's F3 were cited as reasons. The last few Mito SP525s produced were white in colour, and personally signed by MV Agusta CEO Giovanni Castiglioni, thus ended the legacy of the Mito, alongside the end of the Raptors. Last Cagiva-branded bikes were Raptor and Mito 125cc. The Cagiva brand is no longer active, the production being focused on MV Agusta. In the early 1980s Cagiva began to manufacture dirt bikes and started a massive public relations program with the opening of its North American branch. It hired Ron Turner and Duane Summers to test and develop its bikes. Cagiva motocross bikes were characterized by their fast powerful engines and innovative features, such as the MX line that had only one spring in the front forks with one fork controlling dampening and the other spring. At the end of the 1970s the company began campaigning the Grand Prix motorcycle racing circuit. Randy Mamola was its lead rider from 1988 to 1990, and he achieved Cagiva\u2019s first podium result. It would also have some technical assistance from Yamaha. In 1991 it signed former world champion Eddie Lawson to its team. Lawson would claim the company's first victory when he won the 1992 Hungarian Grand Prix. John Kocinski would also win a Grand Prix on a Cagiva GP500 (C594), finishing third in the 1994 world championship. In 1990 and 1994 the Italian rider Edi Orioli won the Dakar Rally on the Ducati-powered Cagiva Elefant. Cagiva bought BMCs design for the Mini Moke, manufacturing them in Portugal using British built engines from 1990 until 1993. Intending to transfer production to the Bologna factory early in 1995, the tooling for the Moke was transferred to Italy late in 1993, but production never restarted.   ",

            "text": "Campagnolo is an Italian manufacturer of bicycle components with headquarters in Vicenza, Italy. The components are organised as groupsets (gruppi), and are a near-complete collection of a bicycle's mechanical parts. Campagnolo's flagship components are the Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets with all three representing their recent shift to 12-speed drivetrains.  Super Record and Record are the top groupsets, followed by Chorus, Potenza, Centaur and Veloce.[2] Campagnolo also produces aluminum and carbon wheels, as well as other components (like carbon fiber seat posts, and bottle-cages). Founded by Tullio Campagnolo, the company began in 1933 in a Vicenza workshop.  The founder was a racing cyclist in Italy in the 1920s who conceived several ideas while racing, such as the quick release mechanism for bicycle wheels, derailleurs, and the rod gear for gear changing.  Campagnolo has been awarded more than 135 patents for innovations in cycling technology.[3] At the end of the 1950s, Campagnolo started to manufacture magnesium parts such as wheels for sports cars like Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Maserati, and built chassis for NASA satellites in 1969.[4] In 1963, Campagnolo produced a disc brake for the Innocenti Lambretta TV motorscooter - the first two-wheel production vehicle with such a brake. In the 1970s they also supplied wheels for Ferrari's Formula One cars.[5] Campagnolo worked with the manufacturer Colnago and racer Eddy Merckx and produced lightweight parts for the bike he used to beat the world hour record in 1972. Following Campagnolo's success during the 1970s and '80s, innovation lagged as rival SunTour developed indexed shifting and Shimano combined shifter/brake levers (Shimano Total Integration).  An unsuccessful foray into mountain biking, the overbuilt and heavy Euclid, Centaur and Olympus groupsets contributed to the company's decline during those years.  By the time the expensive Record O.R. (off-road) and Icarus MTB groupsets made it to the market, Campagnolo's reputation was firmly cemented as a road bike brand.  As a result, Campagnolo pulled out of the Mountain Bike market in 1994.  Despite its struggles, Campagnolo introduced its ErgoPower combined shifter/brake levers and renewed its focus on high-end road cycling components. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Campagnolo's increased use of carbon fibre and titanium parts in groupsets and the development of wheelsets.  In 2004, Campagnolo introduced a complete Compact drivetrain with smaller chainrings, to give lower gears than traditional drivetrains.  Other innovations included a Hirth-joint engineered Ultra-Torque external-bearing crankset and G3 spoke lacing for racing wheels.  In 2008, Campagnolo introduced 11-speed drivetrains with Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets.  Campagnolo has released an electronic version of its drivetrain.[6] In April 2018 the company launched 12-speed Record and Super Record groupsets.[7] Campagnolo has focused on road cycling and track cycling.  It has sponsored teams in the UCI ProTour such as Astana, Movistar, Lotto\u2013Soudal, Cofidis, Quick Step-Innergetic (Tom Boonen, Paolo Bettini), and Lampre.  Campagnolo is associated with the victories of Eddy Merckx, who used Campagnolo exclusively and was a friend of Tullio Campagnolo. 1901 Tullio Campagnolo born on 26 August in the eastern suburbs of Vicenza, Italy 1922 Tullio Campagnolo begins his racing career 1930 Campagnolo patents the quick-release hub 1933 After fabricating parts in the backroom of his father's hardware store, Tullio starts Campagnolo SPA with production of the quick-release hub 1940 Tullio hires his first full-time employee.

The logo of the company is the winged wheel. For many years[weasel\u00a0words] Campagnolo provided professional race mechanics with spare parts and neutral technical assistance at races. Campagnolo relies on riders and mechanics to improve products.[citation needed] ",

            "text": "Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A., trading as Gruppo Campari, is an Italian company active since 1860 in the branded beverage industry. It produces spirits, wines, and soft drinks. From its signature product, Campari Bitter, its portfolio has been extended to include over 50 brands, including Aperol, Appleton, Campari, Dreher, Cinzano, SKYY Vodka, Espol\u00f3n, Wild Turkey and Forty Creek Whiskey. Founded in Milan by Gaspare Campari and currently headquartered in Sesto San Giovanni, the Group is now a global company  (sixth-largest player worldwide),[1] marketing and distributing its products in over 190 countries around the world. Production is concentrated in fourteen manufacturing plants: four of which are located in Italy, one in Greece, one in Scotland, one in Ukraine, one in the United States, one in Argentina, two in Brazil and Jamaica, and one in Mexico. Gruppo Campari also owns four wineries: three in Italy (Sella & Mosca, Teruzzi & Puthod, and Enrico Serafino) and one in France (Lamargue). Gruppo Campari employs over 4,000 people and has its own distribution network operating in Italy, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Russia, Switzerland, the UK, Ukraine, Jamaica, Mexico, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, and China. Local distributors are additionally used in over 180 other markets. Gruppo Campari has improved its performance over the years, doubling its size since the year of its first listing on Piazza Affari in 2001, combining organic and external growth. Sales for 2012 amounted to \u20ac1,340.8 million, 76.7% of which was in spirits, 14.6% in wines, and around 8% in soft drinks.[2] The Garavoglia family owns 51% of the share capital of the company. Gruppo Campari traces its beginnings back to 1860, with the birth of its flagship brand and signature, red aperitif beverage- Campari.[3] Born in 1828, Gaspare Campari, the inventor of the recipe, was the 10th child of a simple farmer. At 14 he started working as a waiter and started developing a strong interest in people's drinking habits, coming to create the product that would take his name. Deciding to open his own bar, it became so successful that he opened another in the heart of Milan, making his own cordials, cream liqueurs and bitters in the basement. His choice of location near the Duomo coincided with the opening of Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, contributing to the fame of its bar and its bitters, then called Bitter all'Uso d'Olanda, which became extremely popular at the time.[4] In 1904 the historic production site at Sesto San Giovanni was inaugurated (it would remain in operation until 2005 when the new production site was opened in Novi Ligure). In 1926 Davide, Gaspare\u2019s son, transformed the company by dropping the production of all drinks other than a Campari bitter and Cordial Campari. Davide dedicated his considerable energy and determination to making the brand known across the world.[5] In 1932 Camparisoda, the first single-serve aperitif in the world, was launched. The bottle was designed by Fortunato Depero, one of the most famous Futurist artists of the time. The iconic bottle,[6] unchanged to this day, has become a symbol of everyday \u201cusable\u201d design objects in Italy and the world. According to Italy\u2019s important newsmagazine La Domenica del Corriere [The Sunday Courrier] the new object was a \u201cgenuine novelty and wonder of the season.\u201d  Depero\u2019s invention had many highly innovative features.  It was the first single-dose product, it was ready for consumption and it contained the perfect pre-dinner drink mix of Campari and soda. The bottle's striking design resembled an upside down glass. Davide Campari died in 1936; ten years later, the company incorporated as Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A. The company remained concentrated on this core product for most of the rest of the century, even after Domenico Garavoglia gained control of it in the 1970s.[7] Sales grew especially strongly during the 1960s; by then, the Campari brands were distributed in over 80 different countries, and over another 30 years distribution would cover 190 countries across the globe. The critical step took place at the beginning of the 1990s. The rapid consolidation of the global drinks market, and especially the creation of a small number of dominant players such as Diageo and Allied Domecq, led Campari to make a choice between joining the race for market size or simply defending its core but niche product.[8] The first step towards building a competitive portfolio on the global market came in 1995 with the acquisition of the Italian business of the Dutch Group BolsWessanen. This brought a number of front-ranking names such as Crodino, Cynar, Lemonsoda, Oransoda, Biancosarti and Crodo.[9] In 1998, the group underwent a further expansion with the acquisition of a minority holding and world distribution rights (except for the USA) in Skyy Spirits LLC, owner of SKYY Vodka. Skyy Spirits, LLC became the distributor for the whole Campari portfolio in the USA as part of the deal. Later in 1998 the group gained the Italian distribution rights of Lipton Ice Tea, from Unilever Group.[10] In 1999, expansion continued with the acquisition of Ouzo 12, the anise-based Greek spirit.  In 1999 the group also acquired Cinzano,[11] producing vermouth and sparkling wines and one of the most internationally known Italian brands. In July 2001, the group completed its IPO on Piazza Affari, in Italy's biggest IPO of the year.[12] The shares were priced at the lower end of the indicative price range of 30 to 38. The initial public offering was three times oversubscribed. The group later acquired leading brands like the Dreher aguardiente, the Old Eight, Drury's, Gregson's and Gold Cup whiskies and Liebfraumilch wine. In 2002, Campari finalized the acquisition of Zedda Piras S.p.A. (Mirto di Sardegna), owning a majority stake in Sella & Mosca S.p.A, both companies based in Sardinia, Italy. The same focus on wine brought the group to acquire Riccadonna in 2003, producing Asti sparkling white wine. In December 2003, Gruppo Campari announced the acquisition of Barbero 1891 S.p.A that brought to the portfolio brands including Aperol, Aperol Soda and Barbieri liqueurs in the spirit segment and Mondoro and Enrico Serafino in wines.[13] In December 2005, the Campari Group acquired the Teruzzi & Puthod winery in the Tuscan town of San Gimignano. Teruzzi & Puthod is one of the leading Tuscan wineries for the production of high-quality wines sold in over 20 countries worldwide. In 2006 Gruppo Campari acquired from Pernod Ricard Glen Grant, Old Smuggler and Braemar, along with the distillery where GlenGrant is produced in Rothes, Scotland.  Thanks to this acquisition, the group strengthened its presence in the spirits segment and officially entered the key Scotch whisky segment. In 2007 Gruppo Campari announced the acquisition of Cabo Wabo tequila, created by Van Halen lead singer Sammy Hagar, adding the Tequila segment to the already wide portfolio. In 2009, Gruppo Campari announced the largest acquisition in its history, buying the world's top premium Kentucky bourbon whiskey, Wild Turkey. Along with Wild Turkey bourbon, American Honey liqueur, a honey and bourbon-based cordial, joined the portfolio. The group also took ownership of the distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky as part of the deal. In 2010, Gruppo Campari announced an agreement to acquire Carolans Irish Cream, Frangelico Hazelnut Liqueur and Irish Mist Wiskey Honey Liqueur. On July 6, 2011, Gruppo Campari celebrated the tenth anniversary of its listing on Borsa Italiana in 2001. In December 2012, Gruppo Campari announced the successful acquisition of Lascelles deMercado & Co. Limited, including four brands: Appleton Estate, Appleton Special/White, Wray & Nephew and Coruba, the related upstream supply chain and the local distribution company.[14] In 2014, Gruppo Campari announced the successful acquisition of Averna, Italy's second best-selling bitter, at 103.75 million euros ($143 million). The Averna group owns a portfolio of premium brands, among which are Braulio, a herb-based bitter, and Grappa Frattina, through which Campari entered the grappa category.[15] In March 2014, Gruppo Campari purchased Canadian whisky producer Forty Creek Distillery Ltd. for $185.6 million (Canadian). The sale included 100% of the distillery, including all Forty Creek facilities and whisky stocks. Founder John Hall stayed on as master distiller and blender.

In the 1970s, Canali was the first Italian tailor to introduce mechanised cutting machines.[1] In 1980, 50% of its sales were international.[2] In 2007, the company abandoned its family-managed policy.[3] In 2009, Canali released a bandhgala suit for the Indian market, the only \"indigenization\" ever in the brand's products.[3] In 2010, New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera was the spokesmodel for a Canali advertisement campaign, the first time the brand used an athlete for advertising purposes.[4][5] In 2014, Canali opened its first store in Spain, in Madrid, and signed a franchise deal with the Spanish company Yusty.[2] In 2015, Canali opened a store in Washington DC.[6][7] In December 2015, Canali opened its own online shop for the first time.[8] In October 2017, Canali closed the Carate Brianza factory and dismissed its 134 employees.[9] In November 2017, the company denied rumors it was looking for a buyer.[10] In September 2018, Canali entered the Chinese ecommerce market through a partnership with Secoo.[11] Led by the third generation of the family, Canali employs 1,500 people in seven factories in Italy, where it makes about 250,000 individual pieces of clothing annually.[12] In 2012, 87.5% of the total production was  exported;[13] Canali has 180 boutique stores (including 52 in China[3]), and is also distributed through a network of 1,000 retail stores worldwide.[14] Canali provides a Su Misura service which consists of a tailored-made pieces and personalized artistry to make a piece unique.[14] Canali suits were worn by Gene Hackman in The Firm, Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies, and George Clooney in Michael Clayton.[3]  ",

Candy's appliances are better known through their continued marketing of the Hoover and Kelvinator brands. Over 80% of sales are outside Italy. Back in 1945, the Eden Fumagalli Mechanical Workshop in Monza, manufacturers of precision machine instruments, designed the Model 50, the first all-Italian washing machine, which was launched officially at the Milan Trade Fair in 1946. In that same year, the Candy company was established. The venture into household appliances began when Enzo, one of the three Fumagalli brothers, mailed from the United States, where he was a prisoner of war, rough drawings of a washing machine. His brother Niso, who had started the appliance operations with their father Eden, engineered the switch to the development and production of washing machines. Peppino, the younger brother, set up the administrative and management structure of the company. In 1950, Candy moved into a new factory in Monza and launched the Bi-Matic, the first Italian semi-automatic washing machine. It was a great success, which opened the international markets; Candy thus became the first Italian appliance company to go abroad. In the 1960s, the Automatic washing machine was launched: the first fully automatic one, designed and made in Italy. It had dampers, a thermostat, 550 rpm spin speed, and 10 programs. In 1961, Candy moved to Brugherio, midway between Monza and Milano, where the new company headquarters and a large industrial site were completed, including the company's Research and Development laboratories. In 1966, the Stipomatic was launched: an automatic dishwasher with two compartments; at the same time, the Superautomatic washing machine was launched. In those years, design became a strategic asset in product development: appliances were designed by key names such as Piero Geranzani, Joe Colombo, Marco Zanuso, Mario Bellini, and Giorgetto Giugiaro . Genoa University, in 1968, awarded Niso Fumagalli an honoris causa degree in engineering, acknowledging his pivotal innovations in the washing machine and the many patents he held. The year before, Enzo Fumagalli died, however Candy continued to grow under the guidance of his brothers Peppino and Niso. The latter died in 1990. Peppino Fumagalli was awarded the Cavaliere del Lavoro (Knight of Labour) honour by the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Leone in 1973; He was appointed as CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in 1998. At the end of 2013, the structure of the Group was organised into three Business Sectors: washing appliances, kitchen appliances and small domestic appliances, with full responsibility on relevant product lines. The commercial organization has been split in three geographical areas: Europe, Russia, rest of the world, with strategic facilities in China and Turkey. With the completion of the acquisition program, the international presence of the Group has been consolidated, while R&D and innovation capabilities are centralized in the Headquarters in Brugherio (MB), Italy. On March 9, 2015, Peppino Fumagalli died. His son Beppe then became CEO of the company. The growth strategy was built both on innovation and diversification of the product range, and by acquisitions. In 1971, Candy acquired Kelvinator, a specialist in refrigerators with a worldwide reach. In 1973, Candy reached a major milestone by expanding the portfolio of appliances through the acquisition of La Sovrana: cookers were added to the washing machine and dishwasher ranges. In 1980, Kelvinator UK was acquired, marking the beginning of international manufacturing. In 1985, the Group acquired Zerowatt, producer of top-loading washing machines and dryers. This was followed by Gasfire, an Italian prestigious name in built-in cooking appliances. In 1987, came Rosi\u00e8res, a prestigious French brand, well known for its top-of-the-range built-in cooking appliances. In 1992, Candy acquired Mayc-Otsein of Spain, a specialist in top-loading washing machines. The following year saw the addition of Iberna in Italy, a well-known national brand in the cooling segment. Hoover European Appliances Group was acquired in 1995 with exclusive rights on the brand name and products for the whole Mediterranean area, Europe and the former-USSR territories. Hoover is today a European market leader in floor-care products. Sixty years after the first washing machine, in 2005 the group acquired an established Russian washing machine brand, Vyatka, and its manufacturing site Vesta, in Kirov. The whole range of Candy and Hoover appliances is now marketed in Russia, alongside Vyatka washing machines. In mid-2006, the Jinling brand was acquired in China, together with industrial facilities, sales network, international operations. The company is the country's third largest manufacturer of washing machines on Asian-type platforms (i.e.,vertical axle), which Candy European-type models have been added to. Early in 2007, the acquisition of Doruk with the brand S\u00fcsler in Turkey gave the Group an industrial site for cookers, hobs, ovens, both built-in and free-standing. In September 2007, an agreement was reached with Finland's Helkama Forste company for the acquisition of the exclusive rights on their Helkama and Grepa brands, marketed in the Nordic Region, until end of 2015. In mid-2009 the 100 millionth appliance was produced since 1945, when the very first Candy washing machine was manufactured in the Fumagalli workshop. The 100 millionth appliance is a Candy Grand\u00d3 9 kg washing machine. In the same year, a new branch office was opened in Dubai to manage the development of the market in the Gulf area. The Hoover brand for small and large appliances made a comeback to Australia and New Zealand: the geographical coverage of the Group became close to global. In 2013 the Candy Group completed the acquisition of the Baumatic brand in the UK. Baumatic is a well-known domestic appliances brand established in 1992 in the United Kingdom, specialising in built-in products, free-standing kitchen appliances and wine coolers. As part of Candy's international expansion in the 1970s the company decided to sponsor a Formula One team.  Midway through the 1979 season, Candy became the marquee sponsor for the Tyrrell team with drivers Jean-Pierre Jarier and Didier Pironi.  Tyrrell enjoyed some success in 1979, finishing 4th in the Constructor's Championship, and Candy stayed on as the team's sponsor for the 1980 season.  In 1981, Candy sponsored the Toleman team and was also later involved with Ligier but eventually withdrew from F1. Candy were the shirt sponsors of Liverpool F.C. between 1988 and 1992, debuting in the 1988 FA Charity Shield which Liverpool won 2-1 against Wimbledon, and remembered as the sponsors the last time Liverpool were League champions in 1990 and during the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. Candy last appeared on a Liverpool shirt on 9 May 1992, when they defeated Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup final. Today, Candy's appliances are known more through their continued marketing of the Hoover and Kelvinator brands.  Hoover-branded washing machines are largely Candy designs and are made up from Candy components.  As well as in Europe, Candy operates manufacturing facilities in  Iran. Candy has recently entered the smart home[1] market with release of Candy Bianca, an App and voice controlled machine. On sept 28, 2018 was announced that Haier acquired the Hoover Candy group. Haier is a Chinese multinational company.[2] ",

At one point in the 1930s, Domenico and his family operated ateliers in Rome, Milan and Paris. The Paris atelier was operated by Domenico's brother, Augusto, who closed his atelier when Mussolini declared war on France. Today, there are several businesses going by the name \"Caraceni\" in operation. The original shop operates out of a small location in Rome with a very small workforce. This is run by Tommy and Giulio Caraceni, nephews of Domenico. There are three branches in Milan, all founded by offshoots of the clan, one even claiming to be the \"real Caraceni.\"  However, the cognoscenti consider A. Caraceni, currently operated by Mario Caraceni (son of Augusto) to be the best of the Milan branches.  These suits are what is known as \"bench bespoke,\" meaning they are made one at a time, by hand, to a pattern specifically drawn for each individual customer.[1] Gianni Campagna, once an apprentice at Sartoria Domenico Caraceni in Milan, acquired the Sartoria Domenico Caraceni label in 1998. Under this name, his company makes expensive made-to-measure suits out of the Palazzo Bernasconi in Milan. This business is separate from and not affiliated with the other Caraceni bespoke ateliers in Rome and Milan. The various Caraceni \"sartorias\" have crafted handmade suits for various celebrities over the years, including Tyrone Power, Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Yves Saint Laurent, Gianni Agnelli, Sophia Loren and fashion designer Valentino Garavani. The Caraceni label is also famous for dressing generations of The Kings of Greece and Italy, The Prince of Wales, Prince Rainier of Monaco, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Aristotle Onassis.[2] ",

It claims control of about half of the world market for ice cream machines, including machines both for Italian-style gelato and soft ice cream.[1] Brothers Bruto and Poerio Carlo Carpigiani created the \"Gastecnica S.a.s dei fratelli Carpigiani\" in 1944. Carpigiani produced and patented a gelato machine, named \"Autogelatiera\". The Carpigiani soft serve ice cream machines make a fluffy, whippy ice cream due to their clever whipping action, mixing air and ice cream mix, during the ice cream making process. The technological growth in the 1960s brought Carpigiani to become the worldwide leader in the ice cream machinery, with the invention of the \"hard-o-matic\". In 1964 an American secondary company was founded with the name Coldelite U.S.A., in 1971 Carpigiani bought Cattabriga (concurrent firm), in 1989 the Comenda Ali S.p.A. group bought the Carpigiani Bruto S.p.A. In 1993 Carpagiani was certified UNI EN ISO 9001:1987. It was the first company in the business to receive this certification.[1] In 2003 Carpigiani established Gelato University as a school to teach about artisan gelato making using Carpigiani products.[2][3] Today Carpigiani is present in the markets of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Japan, Russia, Estonia, Brazil, Ethiopia and Australia.

            "text": "Carrozzeria Ghia SpA (established 1916 in Turin) is an Italian automobile design and coachbuilding firm, established by Giacinto Ghia and Gariglio as Carrozzeria Ghia & Gariglio. The headquarters is located at 4 Corso Valentino in Turin. Ghia initially made lightweight aluminium-bodied cars, achieving fame with the Alfa Romeo 6C 1500, winning Mille Miglia (1929). Between the world wars, Ghia designed special bodies for Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and Lancia, one of the most famous was the Fiat 508 Balilla sports coupe (1933). The factory was rebuilt at Via Tomassi Grossi, after being demolished in an air raid during World War II (1943). After Ghia's death (1944), the company was sold to Mario Boano and Giorgio Alberti. The Ghia-Aigle subsidiary was established in Aigle, Switzerland (1948). Following differences between Boano and the company's Naples-born chief engineer and designer Luigi Segre, Boano left the company in 1953 and ownership passed to Segre in 1954. Under the ownership of Luigi Segre, between 1953 and 1957, Giovanni Savonuzzi became Direttore Tecnico Progettazione e Produzione Carrozzerie e Stile and established GHIA as the most influential proponent of that Italian styling that came to define automobile design trends worldwide.[2] The decade between 1953 and 1963 saw many foreign firms ordering Ghia designs, such as Ford (the Lincoln Futura concept car), Volkswagen (the Karmann Ghia), and Volvo. Chrysler and its designer Virgil Exner became a close partner for 15 years, resulting in eighteen Chrysler Ghia Specials (1951\u201353), the K-310, the Chrysler Norseman, the Imperial Crown limousines (Jackie Kennedy, Nelson Rockefeller, and other luminaries owned one), and others. There are even a few Ghia-bodied Ferraris. Ghia also participated in the short-lived Dual-Ghia venture. Production by Ghia was always in very low numbers, giving the company's products even greater exclusivity than those of the other Italian coachbuilders. In June 1953, Pierre Lefaucheux, Renault's chairman, requested Carrozzeria Ghia assistance with the Renault Dauphine.[3]  In 1953, Boano left for Fiat, the factory moved to via Agostino da Montefeltro, and Luigi Segre took over. Ghia then brought in Pietro Frua, appointing Frua as head of Ghia Design (1957\u201360), designing the Renault Floride. After Segres death (1963), Ghia was sold to Ramfis Trujillo (1966), who sold to Alejandro de Tomaso (1967), owner of a rival design house, who took over, but had difficulty in running Ghia profitably. In 1970, he sold his shares to the Ford Motor Company. During this transition period, Ghia had partial involvement in the De Tomaso Pantera, a high-performance, mid-engine car utilizing a Ford V8. After the Dual-Ghia project had ended, the more up-to-date Ghia L6.4 appeared in 1961. Fewer Mopar parts were used, but the car\u2019s bespoke nature meant an astronomically high price and when production ended in 1963 only 25 (or 26) cars had been built. The car's 6,277\u00a0cc (383\u00a0cu\u00a0in) Chrysler V8 has 340\u00a0hp (254\u00a0kW) SAE, and suspension and transmission parts were also hand-picked from Chrysler's production line. Both the front and the rear seats consist of separate buckets.[4] From 1973, the Ghia name became Ford's top trim-level in its mainstream model range. The trend began in Europe and North America (Mustang II, Granada, Capri, Cortina, Escort, and later Fiesta, Sierra, Orion, Scorpio, Mondeo, Galaxy, Focus all had Ghia trim levels), but soon spread worldwide, particularly to the South American (with the Argentinian Ford Falcon and Taunus, the Brazilian Ford Del Rey and versions of Escort, Focus and Mondeo) and Australian markets. One notable exception to this convention was the Scorpio model in the United Kingdom, where it was badged as a Granada Mk.3 \u2013 in this case the \"Scorpio\" name was instead used to designate a trim level higher than Ghia. In the British market, however, the practice of using the Ghia name in such a capacity was finally phased out in 2010. The Titanium name has instead replaced Ghia as the flagship trim level, and is now used globally across all of Ford's markets to denote the top trim level. The British Ford Fiesta retained the Ghia trim designation for the longest period of any model: 31 years 8 months, uninterrupted, from February 1977 to November 2008. In the rest of Europe, the Ghia trim was discontinued as well. As of 2012[update], the Ghia studios produce various concept cars under the Ford banner. ",

It was founded by Sergio Scaglietti in 1951 as an automobile repair concern, but was located across the road from Ferrari in Maranello outside Modena, Italy. Scaglietti gained Enzo Ferrari's trust and respect both through his bodywork and design skills and for providing a retreat for young Dino Ferrari. Their professional relationship began when Ferrari asked Scaglietti to repair and modify race car bodywork in the late 1940s, which was soon followed by orders for full car bodies in the early 1950s.[1] Scaglietti and Dino Ferrari designed a 166 MM, s/n  0050M, the first Ferrari to have a \"headrest\" bump. This feature was subsequently used on most racing Ferraris of the 1950s and 1960s. The idea was initially despised by Enzo but championed by Dino, and 0050M's design became an overall success. The car became a prototype for the Monza range. In the mid-1950s, Scaglietti became the Carrozzeria of choice for Ferrari's racing efforts. Many sports racing prototypes were designed and manufactured at their facility. All those exclusively designed by Scaglietti carried the Scaglietti & C. badge while cars built to outside designs did not. The company's 1958 250 Testa Rossa, with its Formula One-inspired pontoon fenders, is one of the most famous Scaglietti designs. Several of Ferrari's most coveted models such as the 250 California Spyder, 250 GTO and 250 Tour de France were built by Scaglietti to a Pinin Farina design.[2] Today, the former Scaglietti works is owned by Ferrari and used to produce Ferrari's current line of aluminium bodied cars, including the 488 and F12, using both modern and traditional techniques.[1] In 2002, a special edition of the 456, the 456M GT Scaglietti was named in honor of Scaglietti.  This was followed by the 2004 introduction of the 612 Scaglietti, a 2+2 GT car produced until 2010. Despite names honoring Scaglietti, both the 456 and 612 were designed by Pininfarina. Sergio Scaglietti died at his Modena home on 20 November 2011 at the age of 91.[3] Original Scaglietti designs include:[4] Bodies executed to a third party design: Ferrari 166 MM Scaglietti s/n 0050M, rebodied in 1953. 1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa, designed and built by Scaglietti. 1962 250 GTO. 1959 Scaglietti Corvette Carrozzeria Scaglietti badge on a 1958 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa.

            "text": "Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera is an Italian automobile coachbuilder.  Originally established in Milan in 1925, Carrozzeria Touring became well known for both the beauty of its designs and patented superleggera construction methods.[1]  The business folded in 1966.  In 2006 its brands and trademarks were purchased and a new firm established nearby to provide automotive design, engineering, coachbuilding, homologation services, non-automotive industrial design, and restoration of historic vehicles. Carrozzeria Touring was established on 25 March 1926 by Felice Bianchi Anderloni (1882\u20131948) and Gaetano Ponzoni. After achieving success through the middle of the 20th century, the business began to decline as automobile manufacturers replaced body-on-frame automobile construction with monocoque design and increasingly took coachbuilding in-house. After the original firm ceased production in 1966, Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni and Carrozzeria Marazzi preserved the \"Touring Superleggera\" trademark and used it on several occasions to support the company's heritage. The trademark was acquired by the current owner, a family business, which began conducting its activities in 2006 under the name Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera S.r.l.; the new firm is headquartered nearby Milan, its hometown. Carrozzeria Touring traces its roots to the 1926 purchase of a controlling interest in the Milan-based coachbuilder, Carrozzeria Falco, by Milanese lawyers Felice Bianchi Anderloni (1882\u20131948) and Gaetano Ponzoni from Carrozeria Falco's founder, Vittorio Ascari. The new owners changed the name of the firm to Carrozzeria Touring. Bianchi Anderloni, a former test driver for Isotta Fraschini and Peugeot Italia employee, assumed styling and engineering duties while Ponzoni assumed responsibility for administration of the firms business activities.[2] Carrozzeria Touring's location at Via Ludovico da Breme 65 placed the coachbuilder in close proximity to automobile manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Citro\u00ebn and Isotta Fraschini. Predictably, Touring's first bodywork assignments were for chassis produced by these companies.[2] Bianchi Anderloni came to Touring more as an automobile designer than a car constructor, and learned the mechanics of the trade as the company progressed. The company licensed Charles Weymann's system of fabric-covered lightweight frames, a predecessor of their own Superleggera construction system. Touring hired Giuseppe Seregni, who previously collaborated with Bianchi Anderloni on the 1927 Isotta Fraschini 'Flying Star', as Carrozzeria Touring's first professional designer. Touring's skills with light alloy and fabric-covered tubing forms brought commercial success in aircraft production in the 1930s, leading Bianchi Anderloni to develop the Superleggera construction system, patented in 1936. This \"super lightweight\" system consists of a structure of small diameter tubes to form the body's shape with thin alloy panels attached to cover and strengthen the framework. Aside from light weight, the Superleggera construction system gave great flexibility, allowing Touring to quickly construct innovative body shapes. In 1937 at Mille Miglia, Alfa Romeo 6C 2300B was the first appearance of a Touring car built with the Superleggera system. Prior to World War II, Touring gained fame for their Superleggera bodies, particularly those made for the Alfa Romes 8C 2900 and the BMW 328 chassis. The company quickly re-energized after the war, with the Superleggera system widely licensed and copied. Felice Bianchi Anderloni died in 1948 and his son, Carlo Felice \"Cici\" Bianchi Anderloni, (1916\u20132003) took over management of the firm under the guidance of Ponzoni. The two would remain in charge of the firm until the company discontinued production in 1966. Cici's first major project was to create a body for the Ferrari 166 Mille Miglia Touring barchetta, which debuted in 1948. Automotive design critic Robert Cumberford has referred to the body design for the 166 as \"One of the most charismatic shapes ever.\" The egg-crate grill of the 166 became a signature Ferrari design element and is still in use by Ferrari today.[3] Touring was particularly active late in the late 50s, with design and body production for the Pegaso Z-102, Alfa Romeo 1900 Super Sprint,  Alfa Romeo 2600, Aston Martin DB4, Lancia Flaminia GT, Lamborghini 350, Lamborghini 400 GT and Maserati 3500 GT. The Aston Martin DB4, the DB5 (famously driven by fictional character James Bond) and the DB6 were named after David Brown\u2019s initials. He entrusted Touring Superleggera to design their next generation GT after the introduction of the successful DB2. The license agreement enabled Aston Martin to use the design and the Superleggera construction method at Newton Pagnell plant against a licence fee of \u00a39 for each of the first 500 bodies and \u00a3 5 for each further unit. Touring's fortunes began to decline as automobile manufacturers replaced body-on-frame construction with monocoque construction. The carmakers began to build their own bodies in their production lines. However, they were not able to produce less than a few thousand units yearly. Therefore, they decided to assign the body production to coachbuilders. This led coachbuilders to invest in additional manufacturing capacity. Once Touring Superleggera had the new plant in Nova Milanese completed, market fluctuation caused the loss of contractors. The company had to wind-up in 1966, although bankruptcy never occurred. During the winding up, roughly the 80% of Touring Superleggera\u2019s archives caught fire. Seeking to reestablish a record of the firm's production, Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni got in touch with every owner, creating the Touring Superleggera registry and leading it from 1995 on. In 1995, he contributed to  the revival of Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, serving as President of the Jury until his death in 2003.  In his honor the show began to award the \"Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni Memorial Trophy\" to the most elegant car with a body by Touring.[4] In 2006, a group of private investors specializing in high-end automotive makes, bought the brand and trademarks from the late owner. A newly created firm, Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera S.r.l. was established in Milan to provide automotive design, engineering, coachbuilding, homologation services, non-automotive industrial design, and restoration of historic vehicles.[5] At the 2008 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, Touring debuted the Bellagio Fastback Touring, based on the Maserati Quattroporte and the A8 GCS Berlinetta Touring, a concept car powered by a Maserati drivetrain.[6] At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Touring Bentley Continental Flying Star premiered: a shooting-brake model based on the Bentley Continental GTC,[7] coach built in limited series, with the endorsement of Bentley.[8] In 2011, it was followed by Gumpert Tornante by Touring,[9] a superfast Grand Tourer commissioned by the German sports car manufacturer. On the stage of 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Touring Superleggera showcased a static style model based on the space-frame chassis of the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione. It was a tribute to the C52 Disco Volante, a racing car with Touring Superleggera designed body introduced in 1952. The name in Italian stands for \u201cFlying Saucer\u201d. It represents one of the most iconic cars of the history of automobile. The Disco Volante was very streamlined, windtunnel tested and with the body built on a tubular space frame. The C52 shocked the crowd for its utterly out-of-the-ordinary design, influencing the automobile design for decades. The style model gave birth, in 2013 to the Alfa Romeo Disco Volante by Touring,[10] a bespoke car limited-series of eight units that won that year's Design Award at Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este . Revealed in 2014, MINI Superleggera\u2122 Vision is a concept car created in collaboration with BMW Group. It is an electric roadster blending British style with the Italian coachbuilding tradition. Anders Warming, head of MINI design and Touring Superleggera merged their teams to explore new design languages for the British brand.[11][12] The Touring Berlinetta Lusso appeared in 2015. It is a street legal 2-seater coupe featuring a three-volume form based on Ferrari F12berlinetta. Like all modern Touring Superleggera models, it combines hand-beaten aluminium panels with carbon fibre. The series will be built in 5 units.

            "text": "Casa Ricordi is a publisher of primarily classical music and opera. Its classical repertoire represents one of the important sources in the world through its publishing of the work of the major 19th-century Italian composers such as Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, Vincenzo Bellini, Giuseppe Verdi, and, later in the century, Giacomo Puccini, composers with whom one or another of the Ricordi family came into close contact.[1] Founded in Milan in 1808 as G. Ricordi & C. by violinist Giovanni Ricordi (1785\u20131853), the Ricordi company became a totally family-run organization until 1919, when outside management was appointed. Four generations of Ricordis were at the helm of the company, Giovanni being succeeded in 1853 by his son Tito (1811\u2014 1888) (who had worked for his father since 1825). Tito's son was Giulio (1840\u20141912). He had also worked for his father, beginning full-time in 1863, and then took over from 1888 until his death in 1912. Finally Giulio's son, also named Tito, (1865\u20141933) replaced his father until 1919.[2] By the 1840s and throughout that decade, Casa Ricordi had grown to be the largest music publisher in southern Europe and in 1842 the company created the musical journal the Gazzetta Musicale di Milano. As younger employees under their fathers and then as leaders of the company, the succeeding Ricordis made great strides in establishing publishing relationships with opera houses outside of Milan, including La Fenice in Venice and Teatro San Carlo in Naples.  They also established branches of the company within Italy \u2014 in 1864 it expanded to Naples and then to Florence (1865), Rome (1871) and Palermo, as well as in London (1875) and Paris (1888). With this expansion under the elder Tito, another of his accomplishments was in modernizing printing methods. With the acquisition of rival publishers, by 1886 Ricordi handled 40,000 editions as well as the Italian rights to Wagner's operas.[2] In the 20th century, the company's expansion continued with acquisitions and new branches, which included those in New York (1911), S\u00e3o Paulo (1927), Toronto (1954), Sydney (1956), and Mexico City (1958).[3] In its early days, the company established itself under the portico of the Palazzo della Ragione and then close to the La Scala opera house after 1844, eventually moving to its present location on the via Berchet.  However, these premises suffered severe damage from aerial bombardment during World War II, but its collections had already been safely stored away. Following reconstruction after the war, Ricordi was converted to a limited corporation by the family in 1952 and in 1956 it became a publicly traded company. With 135,500 editions by 1991, Ricordi was acquired in 1994 by BMG Music Publishing, which in turn was purchased by Universal Music Publishing Group in 2007. It is now Italy's largest music publisher. Giovanni Ricordi, a violinist, leader of a small orchestra in Milan, as well as \"a genius and positive force in the history of Italian opera,\"[1] in 1803 had a firm, a copisteria, which specialized in producing manuscript copies of music for local music groups,[2] and very quickly, he became official copyist for two theatres.  He entered into what became a short-term partnership with Felice Festa, an engraver and music seller, but that ended in June 1808. The first work, which the new company published in 1808, was a guitar piece by Antonio Nava. This was followed in 1814 by the first catalogue, which contained 143 items. [4] The 1814 catalogue included mostly piano arrangements of operatic tunes and some individual numbers as well as pieces for guitars, but Macnutt notes the most important single inclusion as being the complete vocal score of Simon Mayr's 1806  opera, Adelasia ed Aleramo,[3] which was regularly performed at La Scala until 1820. Throughout these years he was acutely aware of the limitations of copyright law, as varied as it was throughout both the country and the continent. While he was able to secure performance rights to individual numbers and then, engraving them onto copper plates, easily make reproductions from there, he found that the full orchestral scores were still guarded in Italy, although German and French publishers were printing entire scores with impunity.[5] In fact, in regard to the printing of full scores in Italy, Macnutt in his article \"Publishing\" in Sadie, notes that: \"The full scores published in Italy in the first half of the century were eight Rossini scores printed in lithography by [two rival publishers] Ratti Cencetti & Comp. in Rome in the 1820s and a single Bellini opera, Beatrice di Tenda, published by Pittarrelli about 1833, also in Rome.\"[6] It was through the gradual accession to the rights to control La Scala's archives, as well as subsequently-produced operas, that he was able to bypass the limitations on publishing full scores, and\u2014as Gossett notes\u2014\"not be its employee but a private entrepreneur from whom theatres rented materials\".[5] In contrast, many of Ricordi's competitors produced \"hackwork manuscripts\" in no way based on the composers' autographs.[5]  In 1844, the company produced its \"Gran Catalogo\", focused on music for the theatre, and includes the work of what it called its \"house composers,\" which included Rossini, Bellini, Mercadante, Donizetti and Verdi.[4] In addition, another of Giovanni's strategies was to acquire\u2014beyond just the publishing rights\u2014the right to represent the composers to the opera companies and theatres that would present their work, so that successive performances elsewhere would bring in additional royalties. In that way, Giovanni and his successors acquired more-or-less total rights to their composers' works. As Rossini's operas gave way to those of Bellini, the rise of Donizetti following until his death, and then the preeminence of Verdi, the position of each composer was strengthened by this growing strategy.[7] As business expanded, it became clear to Giovanni that also producing string and choral parts, for which there would be great demand by opera house orchestras, was another means of expanding the firm's involvement and also assuring composers that there would be uniformity.[8] However, although Ricordi began to publish full scores from the 1850s, they were never made available for sale, only for rent to opera houses.[6] Quite quickly, as Verdi's operas became more and more popular, this approach extended to producing all of the orchestral parts for each opera, most especially the three great successes of the 1850s, Rigoletto, Il trovatore, and La traviata, and those that followed when Tito Ricordi headed the firm.[8] With the nickname Jules Burgmein, Giulio Ricordi contributed a very great deal to the prestige of the Casa Ricordi as it also produced several magazines (La gazzetta musicale, Musica e musicisti and Ars et labor), and various other once famous publications (La biblioteca del pianista, l'Opera Omnia di Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, L'arte musicale in Italia, Le Sonate di Domenico Scarlatti). The Ricordi company also published Giuseppe Verdi's later operas, Giulio having established a relationship with the composer as a young man. Over a ten-year period, he convinced Verdi to give the young librettist and composer Arrigo Boito the opportunity to help him to revise the original 1857 Simon Boccanegra, a \"trial run\" to plant the idea of Verdi creating a new opera. They presented the revised Boccanegra in March 1881. In alliance with Verdi's wife and Verdi's friend, the conductor Franco Faccio, Ricordi's strategy was to lure the aging composer out of retirement to compose another opera.  While this strategy took some years to achieve, it proved to be successful, as was the opera, Otello, which brought Verdi great acclaim in Milan in 1887. It was followed by Falstaff in 1893, both set to libretti by Boito. But Giulio also had the good sense to promote younger composers of merit, most especially the operatic career of Giacomo Puccini. Others included Amilcare Ponchielli, Alfredo Catalani, Carlos Gomes, Umberto Giordano. Their relationship began in 1884 with the company's support for the printing of the libretto of the young Puccini's first opera Le villi without charge, when it premiered on 31 May 1884 at the Teatro Dal Verme. Fellow students from the Milan Conservatory formed a large part of the orchestra, and the performance was enough of a success that Casa Ricordi purchased the opera. When revised into a two-act version with an intermezzo between the acts, Le villi was performed at La Scala in Milan on 24 January 1885, and the score was published in 1887. To Puccini in particular, Giulio became something of a father-figure, feared (since Giulio often needed to be censorious over Puccini's dilatory work habits) but deeply trusted. Additionally, under Giulio, the company went into the business of printing advertising posters that were extremely popular throughout Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ricordi company posters included works by celebrated graphic artists such as Leonetto Cappiello, Luigi Emilio Caldanzano, Ludovico Cavaleri, Marcello Dudovich, Adolfo Hohenstein (also known as Adolf), Franz Laskoff, Leopoldo Metlicovitz, Giovanni Mario Mataloni, Aleardo Terzi and Aleardo Villa. Having already acquired the La Scala holdings, in 1839 Giovanni bought the copyright to Giuseppe Verdi's first opera, Oberto, as well as to his future compositions, thus marking the beginnings of a long working relationship with that composer by three generations of Ricordis, most especially Giulio Ricordi. However, it is known that Verdi was unhappy with the elder Tito on occasion over what appeared to be the publisher's \"sanctioning, for financial gain, mutilated performances of his works\".[3] These concerns carried over to the 20th century. However, relationships with composers had begun well before 1839. In fact, shortly after Rossini's Tancredi had been staged in Venice in 1813, the composer made the acquaintance of Giovanni, who was then starting his business in Milan although still involved with La Scala. A strong relationship was established between publisher and composer and, between 1846 and 1864, the company published all of his operas for piano and voice, with the composer becoming \"...ruefully aware that music which he had reused from what he took to be a failed opera would now [upon publication] be seen to have been recycled.\"[9] Although Rossini agreed to the publication of his work, it was not without some reservations: writing to Tito Ricordi on 14 December 1864, he accepts that publication will reveal that, \"The same pieces of music will be found in various operas,\" but notes that the time pressure to compose so many works meant that, \"I barely had time to read the so-called poetry to set to music.\"[10] In all, Rossini also worked with three generations of Ricordis. In 1815, the young Donizetti, then almost 18, traveled from Bergamo to Bologna with the aim of further studies, all this having been orchestrated by his teacher Simon Mayr. In addition to providing money, he equipped his young pupil with two letters, one of which was addressed to Giovanni Ricordi, for whom he had been an editorial consultant for some years.  Mayr recommend the young man to the publisher,[11] the result being that Donizetti's first composition to be published, a set of variations on a theme from Mayr's 1813 opera La rosa bianca e la rosa rossa, appeared later that year. It marked the beginning of a lifelong business arrangement between Donizetti and the Ricordi company, except for difficulties in 1839 over the handling of Gianni di Parigi. By 1840, the firm had control of hiring material for many composers: it had acquired Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto in 1824, followed by 19 operas by Rossini, and eight by Bellini, along with the significant group of today's lesser-known composers such as Saverio Mercadante, Nicola Vaccai, Giovanni Pacini, and the brothers Luigi Ricci and Federico Ricci.[3] However, in spite of good relationships with their publishers, 19th century composers' scores suffered massive changes from what they originally wrote. Long after the deaths of Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti, a variety of changes continued to be made to scores at the behest of people such as conductors who (as Gossett notes), if they \"want an extra trombone, it was added, and its origin was soon masked...the entire system encouraged a laissez-faire attitude\"....[12] It was not until the late 19th century that the full orchestral scores of these four major composers were published by Ricordi and this \"marked the beginning of the modern era of publishing\".[12] The company under Tito Ricordi II With the death of Giulio, the firm was headed by his son, Tito II, who has been described as someone who \"lacked both charm and judgment. He and Puccini disliked each other..\",[3] the result being that the composer's La rondine was published by a rival company, Sonzogno, which also handled the work of Mascagni and Leoncavallo, \"[Puccini's] most successful contemporaries\".[3] Upon Tito's retirement in 1919 management passed outside the family, although, with the company's control over the work of Verdi and Puccini, it retained its preeminence. Preparation of critical editions Many poor quality published scores from the 19th century had been poorly-copied or had become severely cut or severely added-to,[1] leading Macnutt to note that the additions to the scores had created \"totally inauthentic versions,\" which were still being used well into the 20th century by performers:[13] \"the widely held view [was] that the existing scores (particularly of operas from the first half of the 19th century) whether for sale or hire, often offer inaccurate or incomplete texts\". This led musicologist Philip Gossett to the view  that \"by the end of the [19th] century, materials rented by Ricordi were frequently far from the composer's original\".[12] Since 1964, under the direction of the company's then-new president, Guido Rignano,[4] critical editions[14] using the composers' autographs and many other sources\u2014including access to the Verdi autographs granted to scholars by the Carrara-Verdi family at the Villa Verdi\u2014have been prepared with increasing cooperation from Ricordi, which has allowed scholars to view the original autographs and has become a collaborator in the preparation of these critical editions. Under the auspices of the University of Chicago's Center for Italian Opera Studies, [15] Philip Gossett has been General Editor for critical editions of Verdi's operas,[14] as well as those for many of Rossini's operas produced in collaboration with the Fondazione Rossini [16] in Pesaro.  Gossett was involved there until 2005; since then he has been working with music publisher B\u00e4renreiter in Germany, which most recently has produced a critical edition of Maometto II soon to be published[17] The Fondazione Donizetti, in the composer's hometown of Bergamo, has been Ricordi's collaborator in the production of critical editions of his operas[18] under the direction of Professor Roger Parker of King's College in London and Gabriele Dotto, who led Ricordi's editorial department from 1992 to 2001. [13][19] Similarly, preparation of critical editions of Bellini's operas began in 1999 by Casa Ricordi working in collaboration with the Teatro Massimo Bellini in the composer's hometown of  Catania.[20] I Capuleti e i Montecchi was the first to appear under the imprint of the University of Chicago.[21]La sonnambula is also available from Chicago in an edition edited by musicologists Luca Zoppelli of the University of Friborg, Switzerland, and Alessandro Roccatagliati of the University of Ferrara, Italy, members of a group for the Ricordi project, which also includes Fabrizio Della Seta and Claudio Toscani, editor of Montecchi.[22] All of this cooperation has \"served gradually to enhance Ricordi's reputation among scholar and performers\"[13] and the extent to which the huge project has already advanced and will advance is illustrated on the Universal Music Publishing Classical Critical Editions website. Other ventures Since World War II, these have included such enterprises as \"Dischi Ricordi\", the company's recording label, which began in 1958, but was preceded by the company entering into the popular music business and founding \u201cRadio Record Ricordi\u201d (\u201cRRR\u201d) ten years earlier. The first record release was  Cherubini's Medea performed by Maria Callas, but the period also saw the beginning of its popular music activities.[4] Ricordi has also developed a role in the publishing of contemporary music, with a catalogue including the work of Giorgio Battistelli, Luciano Berio, Sylvano Bussotti, Franco Donatoni, Lorenzo Ferrero, Bruno Maderna, Giacomo Manzoni, Nino Rota, Salvatore Sciarrino, and Fabio Vacchi. This began in 1984 with the world premiere of Prometeo by Luigi Nono to a libretto by Massimo Cacciari, presented under the musical direction of Claudio Abbado.[4] Notes Sources ",

A. is an Italian manufacturing company specialised in the creation of high-end designer furniture.[1] The \"Amedeo Cassina\" company was created by the brothers Cesare and Umberto Cassina in 1927 in Meda, Brianza, (Northern Italy).[2] After the war, Cassina continued to expand in size and fame, with products which covered a broad range of furniture including: chairs, armchairs, tables, sofas and beds.[3] The company's transformation was bolstered further by commissions for cruise ships,[4][5] top end hotels and restaurants which accounted for a great part of the company's activity right up to the mid-sixties and beyond.[6] In 1964 the \"Cassina I Maestri\" (Cassina Masters) Collection was born, with the acquisition of the rights to products designed by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand, the most important names of 20th century design. These included the LC1, LC2,[7][8][9][10] and LC3 armchairs,[11] and the LC4 chaise longue. Today Cassina is the exclusive worldwide licensee of the Le Corbusier designs.[12] The \"Cassina I Maestri\" collection was widened in 1968 with the acquisition from Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin of reproduction rights to some of the Bauhaus objects and in 1971 the designs of Gerrit Rietveld, Frank Lloyd Wright, and of Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1972.[13] The Masters collection continued with the re-issue in 1983 of furniture by Erik Gunner Asplund, the acquisition from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation of rights of reproduction (1986) of furniture by Frank Lloyd Wright, including the Barrel chair (1937), and, finally, in 2004 furniture by Charlotte Perriand.[14][15] The 1972, the New York MoMA exhibition, \"Italy: the New Domestic Landscape\" curated by Emilio Ambasz was co-sponsored Cassina.[16] In 2005 Cassina was purchased by the Poltrona Frau Group.[17] ",

Castagnari opened up his own workshop and eventually handed the business down to his sons. As of 2013, the company has been passed down through three generations. The Castagnari company is unusual in continuing traditional methods of producing accordions, such as drying the wood in a way that helps enhance the acoustics of the instrument. They have used the same techniques for over a century, and may make an instrument from a single block of wood. Castagnari accordions are known for their distinctive sound. [1] [2]  ",

Chiesi has 28 affiliates[3] in the world, nearly 6,000 total employees[4] and provides medicines to patients in more than 80 nations. In 2018 Chiesi currently has revenues of 1.768 billion euros.[4] In June 2019, Chiesi became a certified B Corporation, thus choosing to adopt a new legal status under US and Italian law. This ensures Chiesi a legal protection to pursue a business model placing social and environmental values on equal footing with profits.[5] Following the acquisition, in 1999, of Huddersfield based Trinity Pharmaceuticals, Chiesi has also had a significant presence in Manchester, United Kingdom.[6] Established in 1935, Chiesi concentrates primarily on developing, producing and marketing respiratory, neonatological and rare disease drugs, along with those for treating muscular and skeletal conditions. Historical therapeutic solutions are a cortisone preparation indicated for asthma, allergic rhinitis and airway inflammation, launched in 1979,[7] and a surfactant life-saving treatment for premature babies, developed by two researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Tore Curstedt and Bengt Robertson.[8] In the rare disease area, a treatment for moderate to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), developed by the researchers Michele De Luca and Graziella Pellegrini, was the first stem cell therapy to be approved in Europe.[9] As well as developing drugs in-house, Chiesi has a policy of developing drugs in collaboration with pharmaceutical businesses outside Italy. Chiesi's operations regarding neonatological drugs have come under criticism for patenting drugs that Chiesi has not been instrumental in developing. Because of this behavior, some of Europe's neonatology wards have experienced economic hardships.[10] The company holds over 3,000 international patents for more than 200 patents families, and employs approximately 800 people dedicated to Research and Development activities, including regulatory in the R&D centres in Parma, Paris, Cary (North Carolina, USA), Chippenham (UK), Oxford (UK), and Sweden. It is especially Chiesi's way of dealing with patents that has caused controversy for the company. 2010 was the year in which turnover broke through the Billion Euro barrier, with Chiesi recording sales growth of 16.4% over the figure for 2009. By 2013 turnover had reach \u20ac1,236,[verification needed] with increases coming primarily from outside the Italian home market.[11] Chiesi Farmaceutici closes 2016 on a high with an annual turnover of \u20ac1.571 million, an increase of more than +7.0% on the previous year (+9.6% at constant exchange rates), and EBITDA equal to \u20ac448 million (a year-on-year increase of over 8.2%). The robust health of the company is reflected by its investment in innovation and development, with R&D expenditure rising by over +12.5% in the 2015-2016 period to reach \u20ac340 m in 2016, 21% of total sales. The Group currently has 47 active projects in research and development and 54 active studies in research and development.[4] In 2014 Chiesi was granted a 10 years market exclusivity on a caffeine citrate pharmaceutical product, both for oral and intravenous use, for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity, an orphan condition. Many prematurely-born infants have trouble breathing and because of this they need caffeine citrate, which stimulates the nervous system controlling breathing[12]. The market exclusivity expired on July 17, 2019[10]. The marketing authorization holder set the list price at 800 kroner in Denmark (approx. 120$, +4000% compared to the cost of galenic formulation). The EU Orphan Medicinal Product regulation prevents the marketing of galenic formulation without the consent of the orphan drug designation holder[13]. Chiesi was accused to exploit legislation that was created to compensate companies that have had substantial expenses with developing new drugs. Chiesi has not clinically developed this form of medication[10], but has published two real world studies [14][15] on a total of 1606 babies across Europe. Chiesi did not want to comment on the list price of the drug[10]. Chiesi Farmaceutici researches and develops therapeutic solutions for respiratory diseases as Asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), both characterized by a reduction in the respiratory flow but driven by a different pathophysiological pathway.[16] New drugs are based on a technology which allows the creation of spray solutions for inhalation of extrafine particles.[17] The company has his focus also on the preterm babies\u2019 care, specifically regarding the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and apnoea conditions, both due to an under-development of the respiratory system. Natural surfactant administered via intra-tracheal route treats RDS, and may also be used for the prophylaxis in neonates at high risk of developing the disease. For the more severe apnoea episodes stimulant drugs are needed, such as caffeine-based treatments.[18] Chiesi Farmaceutici is developing new therapeutic solutions in the area of rare and ultra-rare diseases. For limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a rare eye condition that may lead to blindness, a stem cell treatment has been developed and is marketed in Europe.[19] In 2018 Chiesi achieved European marketing authorization for velmanase alfa, a first-in-class enzyme replacement therapy for alfa-mannosidosis,[20] a ultra-rare condition. Chiesi is also present in nephropathic cystinosis and is developing a new product in Fabry disease. ",

Cinelli was founded in 1948 by Cino Cinelli (born Montespertoli, Italy, 9 February 1916, died 20 April 2001), a former professional road racer and president of the Italian Cyclists' Association.  He was a professional racer from 1937 to 1944, winning Milan\u2013San Remo in 1943, the Giro di Lombardia in 1938, and the Tour of the Apennines in 1937.[1]  He started a company under his name in 1948. Cinelli was the seventh of 10 children, the son of a small landowner near Florence.[2] He became interested in bicycle technology after mechanical failures in races. Failure to interest manufacturers with his ideas in 1946 led him to start his own company. His brother Giotto was making steel stems and bars in Florence and Cinelli moved the business to Milan,  centre of the Italian cycling industry. He made stems, bars and frames but depended on wholesaling for other companies. By his retirement, Cinelli's own goods were half the business. Stems and bars were 80 percent of Cinelli's own sales. Cinelli moved to alloy production in 1963, later than other manufacturers because he was concerned about strength.[2] Annual production of alloy stems and bars rose from 5,000 in the 1950s, to 7,500 in the early 1960s. By 1978 the figure was 150,000. He made no more than 700 frames a year. In 1974, he designed an aerodynamic bike on which Ole Ritter broke his own hour record. The staple product was the Speciale Corsa road model made from 1947. The Speciale Corsa also became known as the \"Super Corsa\" after a supplier sent decals that erroneously said \"Super Corsa\" instead of \"Speciale Corsa.\"[3] Cinelli recently teamed up with San Francisco-based MashSF to create the popular \"Cinelli MASH\" frames, which are widely used in the fixed-gear culture. The Cinelli (MILANO) head badge was originally cloisonne (fired glass on brass) and 55mm tall. Shortly thereafter (c.1953) it was hand-painted with enamel and 56mm tall. In approximately 1958 it was reduced in height to 51mm. In 1978, it became a decal. The design featured a knight's helmet, inspired by a family heirloom, with a red lily -   symbol of Florence - and a green serpent, symbol of Milan. The presidency of the company passed to Antonio Colombo, owner of Columbus tubing, in 1978.  In 1997 Cinelli became a division of Gruppo S.r.l. ",

Beginning that year, the Marone family, Turin industrialists, began to sell shares in the business, culminating in 1992 with an agreement to turn Cinzano International S.A. entirely over to International Distillers & Vintners, a wholly owned subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan.[5] At the time of its sale, Cinzano's share of the vermouth market in Europe was measured in the low single digits, sales that placed it a distant second to Martini.[5] As a result of a 1997 merger, Grand Metropolitan became Diageo; two years later, Diageo sold Cinzano to the privately held Gruppo Campari.[2][6] The Cinzano bicycling team had a central role in the film Breaking Away. Cinzano was well known in Britain for its humorous television advertisements featuring Leonard Rossiter and Joan Collins. One of these featured the pair on a plane journey, with Rossiter accidentally hitting the \"recline\" switch on Collins chair, causing her to spill a glass of the drink over herself.[7]  The Cinzano logo can be seen in the background during the celebration after Michael marries Apollonia Vitelli in Sicily (The Godfather 1972).[clarification needed] The tractor trailer followed by Dave in Breaking Away is a Cinzano truck.[citation needed] Sean Connery makes a large martini with Cinzano in Thunderball.[citation needed]  In the popular British sitcom Gavin and Stacey Cinzano is the preferred drink of Bryn West ",

Instead of following his family's farming business, Ernesto Colnago chose to work in the cycle trade, apprenticing first with Gloria Bicycles at 13, subsequently taking up road racing. After a bad crash ended his racing career, he began subcontracting for Gloria, opened his own shop in 1954, building his first frames the same year.[1][2] While building frames, he remained much in demand as a racing mechanic. He was second mechanic on the Nivea team Giro d'Italia under Faliero Masi in 1955, eventually being employed as head mechanic for the Molteni team of Belgian cycling legend Eddy Merckx in 1963.[3] The company first became known for high quality steel framed bicycles suitable for the demanding environment of professional racing, and later as one of the more creative cycling manufacturers responsible for innovations in design and experimentation with new and diverse materials including carbon fiber, now a mainstay of modern bicycle construction. One of the first big victories on a Colnago frame was in 1957, when Gastone Nencini won the 1957 edition of the Giro d\u2019Italia bicycle race on a Colnago bicycle.[2] In 1960, Colnago achieved more recognition as Luigi Arienti rode to a gold medal at the Rome Olympics on a Colnago bicycle. By the late 1960s, Colnago was generally regarded as one of the builders of the world's best custom road race frames. While Ernesto was the head mechanic of the Molteni team, riders such as Gianni Motta raced on Colnago bikes. A win on a Colnago in the 1970 Milan-San Remo race by Michele Dancelli for the Molteni team inspired Colnago to change his logo to the now-famous 'Asso di Fiori' or Ace of Clubs.[4] After the demise of the Faema team, Eddie Merckx joined the Molteni team, and what ensued was mutual innovation\u2014as Colnago describes it: \"Merckx was an up and coming champion, and I was an up and coming bike builder. So it was a real honour to work for a great champion like Merckx. It helped us to grow... when we made special forks, and special bikes.\" This included the super-light steel frame used by Merckx in 1972 to break the world one-hour record.[5] With a growing reputation from their racing wins, Colnago plunged into the market for production bikes. In the U.S., the early seventies witnessed another bike boom, and Colnago \"pumped out bikes as though the future of humankind was at stake.\" The mainstay of the Colnago line in the 1970s was the Super, followed by the Mexico, named in honor of the successful hour attempt. Other models were added including the Superissimo and Esa Mexico. While the finish on these early Colnagos could be variable, they were great riding bikes and developed a cult-like following.[6] In 1979, Ernesto Colnago presented Pope John Paul II with a custom, gold-plated steel bicycle.[7] In response to criticism that his frames were not stiff enough, next Colnago experimented with ways to change the behavior of frame components. In 1983, he introduced the Oval CX with an oval-shaped top tube to add stiffness. He then experimented with various crimped-tube frames which became production models as their top of the range frames, beginning with the \"Master.\" Later \"Master-Light\", Master Olympic and Master Piu extended the range. Colnago built a frame from Columbus tubing used by Giuseppe Saronni to win the world professional road race championship in 1982, and afterwards a short-lived collection of bikes were badged with the Saronni name.[8] In 1983, Giuseppe Saronni would go on to win the Giro d'Italia stage race on a Colnago bicycle.[2] Since the 1980s, while Colnago continued to produce high-end steel bikes, they began to produce bike frames using material other than steel including titanium, aluminum, carbon and mixed material frames. One unique frame from this period, the Bititan, has a dual titanium down tube. Crimped and oversize tubes appeared on the Tecnos\u2013one of the lightest production steel bikes produced, and the same oversize tubes and crimping were used on the aluminum Dream frame. In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pista\u2013a full monocoque carbon fiber bike with disc wheels that was shown at the Milan bike show.[9] Subsequently, Colnago worked with Ferrari in developing new carbon fiber technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago's innovative Precisa straight-bladed steel fork (1987). Colnago also experimented with multi-material frames, including the CT-1 and CT-2 constructed with titanium main tubes, carbon fiber forks and rear stays, and a similarly constructed (although short-lived) Master frame constructed with steel main tubes, carbon forks and stays.[10] Colnago's early attempts at carbon fiber frames were not commercially successful, but the lessons learned were embodied in their flagship frames, such as the C-40, the most sought after bicycle (1994), and its successor, the C-50 (2004)\u2013respectively named for Colnago's 40th and 50th years in bike building. These carbon fiber frames set new standards of excellence. They were built using a modified form of traditional bike frame construction, substituting carbon fiber lugs for microinfusion cast steel, and carbon fiber \"tubes\" for the complex steel tubes used for steel frame construction. Similar building techniques are used in the latest offering, the C59, named (as before) for its year of production. While we take for granted the spread of carbon frames, their success was not a foregone conclusion: \u201cWhen we built the C40 we were the only ones to build carbon frames and all the mechanics and competitor technicians were saying that they would be too dangerous to use on cobbled roads, especially with the straight carbon forks. There was a company that wanted to fit suspension forks on the bicycle, but I wasn\u2019t going to have suspension forks on the C40. The night before Paris- Roubaix I had Mr. Squinzi, the Mapei boss, on the phone to me raising his concerns about using such a delicate-looking thing. I told him that we\u2019d done all of the tests that we could on the frame and the fork and we were certain there would be no problem. I had to take personal responsibility for what was going to happen and I spent all night worrying about it, barely able to sleep. But when I heard that there were 4 Mapei riders in the break, I knew I could relax.\u201d [11] The C40 went on to win 5 editions of Paris-Roubaix in 6 years.[11] An interview with Ernesto Colnago in which he describes various iconic Colnagos (filmed in the factory museum) is available on YouTube here. Colnago uses a black symbol similar to the \u2663 (\"Clubs\") symbol used on playing cards. Colnago frames' graphics evolved from a font with gravitas to elaborate and/or creative paint. Colnago has sponsored at least one professional team every year since 1974, often sponsoring more than one. In addition, other teams in the peloton have competed on Colnago bikes. Probably the most famous was the Molteni team which included Eddy Merckx, but the world champion, Giuseppe Saronni also rode Colnago bikes throughout his career, from 1977 with Scic, later with Gis Gelati and with Colnago-Del Tongo. Colnago was well known as a sponsor of the legendary Mapei cycling team throughout the 1990s. For 2005, Colnago sponsored the professional cycling team Rabobank. Colnago has also been the bike sponsor for the American domestic team, Navigators for whom the Australian sprinter Hilton Clarke was a member 2005-2008. For 2006, Team Milram joined their list of professionally sponsored teams featuring well-known Alessandro Petacchi and Erik Zabel. In addition, Colnago serves as a co-title sponsor of the Landbouwkrediet-Colnago professional cycling team that competes on the UCI Europe Tour and was the official frame supplier to Team Tinkoff in 2007. Starting in the 2011 Tour de France, Team Europcar has ridden Colnago frames. For 2012, Colnago is sponsoring Colnago-CSF Bardiani. A full list of teams is provided below. All years are inclusive.[12] Until early 2006, Colnago produced virtually all of their entire frameset range at their Cambiago factory, although persistent rumors of subcontracting out the more basic frames go all the way back to the 1970s. Alan produced some aluminum frames for Colnago in the 1980s, including single and dual downtube road and cyclocross models. In March, 2005, Colnago announced that they were joining the Taiwanese-based A-Team, whose members include Giant, Merida and SRAM\u2014the first Italian manufacturer to do so, to produce mid-ranged bicycle models for the Japanese and European markets.[13] Beginning in 2006, Colnago sourced the Primavera and the Arte from Giant Bicycles of Taiwan. Both received favorable reviews, although some thought the shift of manufacturing out of Italy was a matter of some regret. There was some controversy in 2006 over whether Giant would be producing additional models, including carbon frame models, for Colnago. According to statements by Ernesto Colnago this was not the case: Despite this denial, since 2007 Colnago's carbon monocoque CLX frame has been manufactured in Taiwan.[15] In 2008, a second Colnago carbon fiber model, the CX-1 was also sourced in Taiwan. The top of the line Colnago frame, the C64, as well as the Master, and the now discontinued C60, C59, C50, Extreme Power, Extreme C are (or were) manufactured and painted in Italy.[16] In a series of public statements, Colnago has insisted that all designs originate with the Italian design team, claiming that the essence of what makes a Colnago is design. The mid-range carbon offerings are currently being sourced from Taiwan, (as are many bicycle manufacturers' offerings), and as of 2011, the M10 (which stands second in the model lineup) is made in Taiwan and assembled and painted in Italy, while the CX-1 is completely made in Taiwan.[17] The current top of the line frame, the C64 is the only carbon frame still made fully in Italy.[18] Learn how to identify the different Colnago steel frames produced from 1968 to the late 1980's  Other steel models include the Export (1982-3), the C-97 (Thron tubing Decor era), the Elegant (mid '90s EL-OS tubing) and the Classic (~2000; a descendant of the Super/Superissimo in Zona tubing). Over the years, Ernesto Colnago built steel cyclocross frames for individual professional riders and did not sell any steel frames to the public. A handful have been identified, an early one based on the Colnago Super and built for Roger de Vlaeminck. Photos are available here.  This frame sold in November 2012 on eBay for approximately $1200 US. Three or four additional Super CX bikes have also been identified. Another frame surfaced a couple of years ago, and appears to have been built in the mid to late 90s, loosely based on the Colnago Crystal, specifically labeled \"Master\" on the rear brake hanger. Lugs and seat stays are similar to those on the Crystal, slightly beefier tubing than other road models (32mm OD downtube, 29mm seattube), relaxed wheelbase, top tube routing for rear brake and derailleur, traditional routing for front derailleur but no braze-on for front derailleur. Colnago bottom bracket shell. Straight mtb style threadless fork (no formal crown). No serial number stamped on dropout. Colnago factory contact unable to identify year or provide further information. Photos are available here. Colnago built a couple of bikes for the Italian cyclocross and MTB champion Luca Bramati. Bramati rode a yellow steel, lugless Colnago cyclocross bike in the '96 Worlds in Munich, considered to be one of the most exciting races ever, where he placed third. His bike had a front fork with a traditional brazed fork crown, and full front/rear gear cable brazings. The tubing looks just slightly oversized, and overall the bike looks quite similar to Bramati's Colnago MTB that he raced in Atlanta in the '96 Olympics. Another may have been built for Bert Hiemstra in 1998/1999, Rabobank rider. This was a lugless steel frame, badged \"Colnago Competition\" in Rabobank colors, 59\u00a0cm CtT, set up with 9 speed Dura Ace and a unicrown fork.  Sold in the UK in 2012. Although not very common or widely available in the American market, Colnago did produce a number of mountain bikes. Some featured the Master profile tubing found on the Colnago road bikes. ",

            "text": "Colotti Trasmissioni (Colotti Transmission) is an Italian mechanical engineering firm located in Modena, Italy.  It specializes in gears, limited-slip differentials and transmission systems for racing cars. Valerio Colotti, who is famous as the chassis designer/engineer of Maserati 250F, started his own company called Tec-Mec in 1958.  One of the first achievements was the design and manufacture of differential gear set/housing for Rob Walker, which solidified his reputation in the Grand Prix circles. After building a GP car for Jean Behra, which became known as Behra-Porsche, Colotti built his own Grand Prix car named Tec-Mec F415, based on Maserati 250F in 1959, with Fritz d'Orey as the driver who finished 10th at 1959 French Grand Prix.  At about the same time, Alf Francis, the Chief Engineer at Rob Walker Racing, started working with Colotti, changing the Tec-Mec name to Colotti-Francis. Colotti-Francis was responsible for a Formula Junior car named T.C.A.(Trips Colotti Automobili) built for Graf von Trips, but this project ended with Trips' death at 1961 Italian Grand Prix held at Monza, where his Ferrari 156 collided with Jim Clark's Lotus 21, when a 3rd-place finish would have secured Count Trips the first ever Grand Prix World Championship title for a German, which did not materialize until 1994. Rob Walker asked Colotti to analyse and modify the front suspension of two Lotus racing cars belonging to Rob Walker Racing, and the plausible result prompted Rob Walker to let Colotti review the design of his own Grand Prix car, Walker Special, which was being built at the time.  With the new 1.5 Liter Formula One regulation going into effect for the 1960 season, Colotti designed and built T.32 5 speed and T.34 6 speed transaxles, which weighed less than 35\u00a0kg, suitable for lower-torque high-rev 1.5 Liter engines mounted behind the driver. Outside of racing field, Colotti worked under the name G.S.D. (Gear Speed Developments), such as on a transmission of a Hovercraft for Britten-Norman of Isle of Wight, and a power take-off/transfer system for the mixer drum on Cement mixer trucks, which replaced the long chain drives previously used. Francis and Colotti knew the shortage of limited slip differential manufacturers was a big hardship experienced by  Grand Prix constructors then.  For example, Colin Chapman had his in-house engineers, Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, develop the sequentially shifting transaxles for Lotus 16 and Lotus 18, which he had originally asked Richard Ansdale and Harry Mundy to design for Lotus 12.  But despite these transaxles being unique and innovative, they still incorporated limited slip differentials made by ZF of Germany, which was about the only source, and the technology used was an old slip-limiting principle invented by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s for Auto Union GP cars. Colotti, whose company name had become Colotti Trasmissioni (Colotti Transmission) by this time, researched the issue, developed and patented a unique mechanism called Coppia-Frenata to limit the slip on the differential gears.  This limited-slip differential became popular among the Formula 1 and other racing teams, being one of the few viable alternatives to the ZF product. In 1962, Colin Chapman asked Colotti to design and build a transaxle for a car designed for Indianapolis 500.  This high torque specification 4 speed T.37 transaxle was designed for Small Block Ford-based engines. On Lotus 29, which had a Ford 256 CID all-aluminium OHV pushrod V-8, based on their iron Fairlane 260 CID V-8, the T.37 was used with 2 speeds blanked off. [1] And the car went on to score the 2nd and 7th-place finishes at 1963 Indy 500 in the hands of Jim Clark and Dan Gurney, respectively. T.37 was, with all four drive/driven gear sets, then used by Eric Broadley on Lola Mk6, and by Ford for the Ford GT40 in the joint project with Broadley.  Gianpaolo Dallara asked Colotti Trasmissioni to develop and manufacture a racing version of the transaxle for Lancia Montecarlo, which was to be Fiat Group's FIA Group 5 weapon.  Equipped with a new quick-response limited-slip differential called Duo-Block, this transaxle was very successful by winning the World Endurance Championship in 1980 and 1981, and Duo-Block was patented. [2] Colotti Trasmissioni was also active in the Rally sector, by developing a new kind of limited-slip center differential for four wheel drive competition cars.  This torque splitting/proportioning device is patented as Split-Diff. Valerio Colotti having worked for Ferrari in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and having engineered the chassis and transmission of their first GP car of its own design under Enzo Ferrari, Aurelio Lampredi and Gioacchino Colombo, Piero Ferrari asked Colotti Trasmissioni to build an exact replica of Ferrari 125, with the original engine and drawings provided by the Maranello factory.  This first-ever Ferrari-built Grand Prix car had been lost, and the completed replica currently resides in Museo Ferrari in Maranello, alongside newer Ferrari F1 machines. ",

This includes performing the process engineering and using 3D development and simulation tools to test the concepts and plan the factory.[6]  Comau began in 1973 as the COnsorzio MAcchine Utensili to unite all the businesses based in Turin and the surrounding area that were supplying equipment to the Togliattigrad VAZ plant in Russia. In 1977, MST S.p.A., Morando S.p.A., I.M.P. S.p.A. and Colubra Lamsat S.p.A. merged into a single company named Comau Industriale S.p.A. The following year, Comau S.p.A. was officially founded, bringing together all the plants and industrial activities of Comau Industriale S.p.A. It was later renamed Comau Finanziaria S.p.A.[1] In 1984, the company branched out of Europe as Comau Productivity Systems Inc. was founded to start development of commercial and industrial activities in North America. Comau Finanziaria S.p.A. gained a majority interest in Italtech S.p.A., which specialized in injection molding machines for plastic materials in 1988. The following year, it acquired Berto Lamet, a sheet metal die producer, and U.T.S., which specialized in product and process engineering. Berto Lamet then took over TEA, a company that manufactured injection molds and, in 1990, it took over the Spanish company, Mecaner S.A., which specialized in producing sheet metal dies. In 1995, the company grew throughout South America, Europe, North America and Asia. Comau do Brasil Ind e Com. Ltda and Comau Argentina S.A. were launched with all Comau Business Units joining the Mercosur market. In Germany, Comau Deutschland GmbH was established. Comau Productivity Systems expanded its structure and the name was changed to Comau North America Inc. Additionally, a representative office in Beijing, China, was set up. In 1996, Comau France S.A. was founded. The company officially changed its name, it became Comau S.p.A. In 1997, the company gained a majority interest in Geico S.p.A., a producer of painting systems within the automotive industry. Comau India Pvt. Ltd. in Pune was set up as the company's headquarters in Southeast Asia. Comau Poland Sp.z.o.o., a production plant for sheet metal dies, began operation in Tychy and, later that year, began offering maintenance services as well. In the same year, Comau Service was launched to provide full maintenance services to customers worldwide. In 1999, Comau took over the French company Sciaky S.A., a producer of body systems and welding guns, and the company is renamed Comau Sciaky S.A. Also that year, Comau S.p.A. gained a majority interest in Renault Automation S.A. of France, a company specializing in engineering, metal cutting, mechanical assembly and body final assembly. In the same year, Fiat S.p.A. acquires Progressive Tool and Industries Co. (PICO), a U.S. company experienced in body systems manufacturing, and it was subsequently renamed Comau Pico. In the UK, the Pico Estil in Luton became Comau Estil; in South Africa, Aims in Uitenhage is renamed Comau South Africa Pty. Ltd.  In 2000, Comau Automotive Equipment Colt., in Shanghai was opened, Comau Belgium N.V. was established to develop maintenance services in Northern Europe and Comau Systems Services S.L. began operations in Madrid. The next year, Comau S.p.A. acquired two companies in automotive product and process engineering and industrialization, Germann-Intec GmbH and Team Resources Romania, which became Comau Rom\u00e2nia S.A. Comau Australia opened in Adelaide in 2001. In 2002, Comau Ingest Sverige AB was established in Sweden; in 2003, Comau Russia Srl and Comau (Shanghai) International Trading Co. Ltd. began operations with a focus on import-export activities. Comau Sciaky SA became the full owner of Gerbi & Sciaky, a company in France that produced electrical welding guns, changing its name to Sciaky S.A.S. in 2004. The next year, Comau Service France and Comau Sciaky and Sciaky S.A.S. were consolidated within Comau France S.A. In 2005, Comau Germann-Intec GmbH merged with Comau Deutschland GmbH. In 2007, Comau-Germann Intec GmbH was started in Germany with a focus on engineering activities. [5] In 2013, Comau expanded its presence in China with three new sites. Comau Turkey and Comau Czech were also opened to better serve the Middle and Eastern European markets. Soon after, Comau established a new office in Munich, Germany and expanded into Mexico. Comau S\u00e3o Paulo and Comau Thailand were established in 2015, while in 2016, Comau opened its HUMANufacturing Innovation Center in Pontedera (Pisa), Italy.

(Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8k\u0254sta kro\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0re]), operating as Costa Cruises (Italian: Costa Crociere), is an Italian cruise line, based in Genoa, Italy, owned by Carnival Corporation & plc.[1][2] Founded in 1854 as Giacomo Costa fu Andrea, the company originally operated cargo ships, carrying olive oils and textiles.[3] In 1924, the company passed to founder's sons (Federico, Eugenio and Enrico) that started commercial activities, buying the ship Ravenna. Commercial activities continued until the introduction of passenger services in 1948,[3] with regular services between Italy and South America. The company later converted its entire fleet to full-time cruising, and as an independent company became one of the largest cruise operators in Europe. Acquired by Carnival Corporation in 2000, Costa Cruises is now one of ten brands operated by Carnival and accounts for approximately 16% of its revenue.[4] Today, as Costa Cruises Group, the company is one of the main operating companies in the Carnival group, with executive control of the group's activities in Europe. The company is responsible for operation of Costa Cruises in Italy, and AIDA Cruises in Germany and was formerly responsible for the operation of Ibero Cruises in Spain. AIDA was previously a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises, being transferred to Costa following the merger of Carnival Corporation and P&O Princess in 2002. Ibero Cruises is a new brand, created in 2007 as a joint venture between Carnival Corporation and Orizonia Group. The Costa Cruises brand currently operates fourteen cruise ships, which all sail under the Italian flag and provide cruise holidays in the Mediterranean, Northern Europe, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, South East Asia and South America. The company gained international attention on January 13, 2012 when one of its cruise ships, the Costa Concordia ran aground and capsized off the coast of Italy, because Captain Francesco Schettino wanted to 'salute' the Italian island of Giglio off Tuscany with a close sail past at night.[5] The captain was one of the crew to leave the sinking ship early while many passengers were still on board.[6] Thirty-two people died.[6] Six weeks later the company made headlines again when a fire on Costa Allegra left it drifting without power for 13 hours in waters near Somalia frequented by pirates, before the ship was taken under tow.[7] On July 27, 2014, after tugboats towed the wreck of the Costa Concordia 200 miles (320 kilometers) north from the island of Giglio over a period of five days, the Costa Concordia arrived in its home port of Genoa, Italy, for eventual scrapping.[8] The total cost of the disaster is estimated to be over $2 billion.[9] On February 11, 2015, Captain Francesco Schettino was found guilty by an Italian court of multiple manslaughter, causing the shipwreck, and abandoning his passengers and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.[10] An Italian appeals court on May 31, 2016 upheld the 16-year prison sentence.[11] In February 2018, Costa announced its partnership with football club Juventus - \u201cThe Italian Champion at Sea, The Glorious League.\u201d[12] As of 2015[update], according to Scott Knutson, vice president of sales and marketing who for Costa Cruises North America Costa was \u201c... uniquely positioned as the only international brand that hasn\u2019t adapted its product to the American market.  That authenticity allows us to go to a certain segment of the market. It\u2019s those vacationers who like the international experience \u2014 the food, the wine, the service.\" Italians accounted for 25 to 30 percent of bookings on most Costa cruises, and they were followed by passengers from France, Germany and Spain. Depend on the season or destination, North Americans could made up 5 to 15 percent of the passenger's list's.  The \"universal\" language on board was English.[13] See also Carnival Cruises Accidents and incidents for incidents associated with the parent company's other cruise operations. On Sunday October 22, 1961, the Bianca C. was off Grenada when an explosion occurred in the engine room causing the deaths of two crew members and the ship to catch fire. Local fishermen helped rescue the passengers and crew but as the local authorities did not have the equipment to extinguish the fire the ship was left to burn until the British frigate HMS\u00a0Londonderry arrived from Puerto Rico. The burning ship was in the main anchorage and would block the harbour if it sank there, so the Londonderry towed it to a different location where the Bianca C. sank. On January 13, 2012, Costa Concordia ran aground off Isola del Giglio, Tuscany. The ship capsized and partially sank, killing 32 people. In 2014, the ship was parbuckled and refloated with caissons, and in July 2014 it was towed to its home port of Genoa, where it was dismantled and eventually scrapped. On February 27, 2012, Costa Allegra suffered an engine room fire and went adrift in the Indian Ocean. After several days adrift without power, the ship was towed to the Seychelles island of Desroches but was unable to dock there. She was then towed to Mah\u00e9, Seychelles, where the passengers disembarked.  No casualties were reported. On 9 March 2012, it was announced that Costa Allegra would not return to service with Costa, and she was given to Themis Maritime Ltd ship company.[20] In late 2012, Costa Allegra was beached at Aliaga, Turkey, for scrapping.[21] Costa Pacifica moored at Katakolo, Greece.

            "text": "Crumar was an Italian electronic musical instrument manufacturer established by Mario Crucianelli in the late 1960s,[2] which manufactured synthesizers and keyboards during the '70s and '80s. Its name stands for \"CRUcianelli and MARchetti\", the names of Crucianelli and business partner Marchetti.[2]  The company appears to have grown out of the Crucianelli accordion company and also continued to manufacture accordions under both names. Crumar started out manufacturing electronic pianos and string synthesizers, such as the Compac-piano (1972/1973), Compac-string (1973), Pianoman (1974) and Stringman (1974), the functions of which were combined  in 1975 with the Multiman (also known as the Orchestrator), and in 1977 with the Multiman-S.[2] The company was also known for \"clonewheel\" organs made in the 70's and 80's, such as the Organizer (1974), Organizer T1 (1978) and T1/C (1981), T2 (1978), and T3 (1981).[2] In 1978, Crumar released their first full-fledged synthesizer, the DS-2, which had one of the earliest digitally controlled oscillators (DCO).[3] Crumar synthesizers are comparable and contemporaneous to Moog synthesizers and other analog synthesizers; in fact, the Crumar Spirit synthesizer (1983) was designed by Bob Moog himself, along with Minimoog co-designer Jim Scott and Tom Rhea (who wrote Moog manuals).[4] In 1984,[2] Crumar began producing polyphonic synthesizers utilizing DCOs under the Bit name (Unique in the US).[4]  The Performer is a polyphonic analog Strings and Brass machine produced at the end of the 1970s and is slightly compact with just 49 keys and is fully polyphonic (can play all 49 notes simultaneously). Programming is simple and clearly laid-out with just 15 sliders and a few buttons. A solid black chassis and wood end-cheeks round out this classic and often overlooked string machine.  The Performer is best remembered for its Strings more so than its Brass and was used by Duran Duran. In the early 1980s, Crumar formed a design/distribution collaborative with New York-based Music Technology (MT) in an effort to commercialize the Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer. Crumar and the MT designers worked in conjunction with some respected names in electronic music to produce the Crumar GDS (General Development System)[5] in 1980, and the Digital keyboards Synergy[6] in 1981. These synthesizers, which used additive synthesis technology and phase modulation, were bulky and cumbersome, but were state-of-the-art at the time. The complexity of this project, along with Japanese competition (notably from the Yamaha DX7) contributed to the company's eventual downfall. Crumar ceased trading in 1987, just as they were about to launch a high-quality sampler at the lower end of the market. In 2008 the Crumar brand was acquired by a new Italian company that soon began producing new keyboards under the Crumar name, including the Baby Grand piano (introduced at the 2008 Musikmesse), Bassman bass synth, and Mojo clonewheel organ. In 2018 a digital electric piano called Seven was introduced. It featured modern day technology in a wooden vintage 1970's style case. Crumar T2 Organizer Crumar T2 Organizer Crumar keyboard ",

The company was founded in 1972 by Lino Dainese, now a minority stakeholder in the company,[1][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] expanding through organic growth and acquisitions, including Italian helmet manufacturer AGV (2007).[2] Investcorp bought a majority of the Dainese Group in 2014.[3] The company has been led by CEO Cristian Silei since 2015 [4] Dainese Group helmets are branded AGV, while the suits, jackets, shock-absorbing armor and back protectors, pants, boots, gloves and accessories are branded Dainese. These products are made with materials including traditional cowhide, kangaroo skin, aramid, carbon fiber and titanium, and are sold off-the-rack, made-to-measure, or custom made.[5] In 2017 Dainese added the motorcycling fashion clothing brand Settantadue (\"seventy-two\" in Italian).[6][7][8] Dainese has diversified its product range over the years to cover mountain biking, skiing and horse riding, often using the technologies developed for motorcycle racing.[9][10][11] Lino Dainese started the company in 1972 when he was 20, making protective motorcycle apparel in Molvena, Vicenza, Italy.[12] The first article of clothing was a pair of motocross pants.[13][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The company has been closely associated with motorcycle racing since its foundation, which has informed its product development, focused on safety, performance and ergonomics.[14]  The company acquired the Italian helmet manufacturer AGV in July 2007.[15] The Dainese Group was acquired by Investcorp of Bahrain for \u20ac130 million in 2014. Lino Dainese retained a minority holding and continued as President.[16] Following the Dainese acquisition by Investcorp, Lino Dainese founded D Airlab, a research center for applying D-air technology for non-sports users, such as construction workers and the elderly.[17] The Group's headquarters are in Italy, as are its Research & Development and Design Centers. They have regional office in California, US, and one in Hong Kong.[18][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Since its acquisition by Investcorp, the Dainese Group has reported annual revenue growth from \u20ac117 million in 2013 to \u20ac184.7 million in 2017, during which period the number of employees increased from 609 to 757, as of March 2018.[19][20] The Dainese Technology Center (D-Tec) develops protection and apparel-related technologies for the group companies and other applications. The company has registered 118 patents.[21] Dainese D-air is an electronically-actuated airbag system developed for motorcyclists. Development began in 1995 and the first working prototype was tested on a race track in 2000. Dainese D-air activated for the first time in an official race when the Italian rider Simone Grotkyj crashed during a 2007 MotoGP practice session at the Valencia circuit.[22][23] The first Dainese D-air system launched on the market was the racing version in 2011. In 2015, Dainese began selling the Misano 1000, the first standalone jacket for road use incorporating its Dainese D-air Street system, and a version for skiing.[24] D-Tec hired MIT professor and former NASA Deputy Administrator Dana Newman and space architect Guillermo Trotti to develop the BioSuit, a space suit that uses lines-of-non-extension on the human body to improve freedom of movement for astronauts during extravehicular activities while maintaining constant pressure. In September 2015, European Space Agency astronaut Andreas Mogensen was the first to test the Dainese SkinSuit in space during his iriss mission to the International Space Station (ISS). This skin-tight garment is designed to be worn inside the ISS, providing head-to-foot loading to counter the lack of gravity and reduce the risk of post-flight injuries to the spinal intervertebral discs. The SkinSuit was worn on the ISS a second time in November 2016, by the French astronaut Thomas Pesquet during the Proxima Mission.[25][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] In 2017, working in partnership with the Italian multinational energy company ENEL and occupational health professors and doctors at Bologna University and Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, D Airlab developed the Safety Jacket, an airbag system for protecting workers at risk of accidents from impacts or falling when working at height.[26][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][27] In 2017, Dainese collaborated with Emirates Team New Zealand crew members to design Sea-Guard, the first safety garment developed for yacht races to integrate impact protection and flotation tasks in a single solution.[28][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Dainese has been working with the Trauma Team at the Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, since 2013 as part of its Dainese Advanced Research Program, which analyzes the effects of motorbike accidents on the human body to improve the design of protective equipment and general rider safety.[29] Dainese has employed designers including Yohji Yamamoto, Adriano Goldschmied, Marc Sadler, Renato Montagner, and Aldo Drudi.[citation needed] The company has won the following design awards. 2001 T-Age suit - ADI Compasso d'Oro International Award[30][circular reference] 2017 Mugello R suit - RedDot Design Award[31] 2017 Mugello R suit - Good Design Award[32] 2017 Mugello R suit - International Design Excellence Award[33] 2017 Pro Armor protector - RedDot Design Award[31] 2017 Pro Armor protector - Good Design Award[34] 2017 Pro Armor protector - ADI Compasso d'Oro International Award[35] 2018 AWA M1 ski jacket - Red Dot Design Award[36] 2018 AWA M1 ski jacket - Good Design Award[37] 2018 Pro Armor protector - ISPO Award[38] 2018 HP1 RC ski jacket - ISPO Award[38] Dainese is a member of Altagamma a trade group of Italian automotive, fashion, recreation, travel, and design companies formed 1992 to advertise and promote high end luxury goods.[39] The Dainese Archivio (DAR) is a permanent multimedia exhibition in Vicenza opposite the Dainese Headquarters which presents the ideas, people and projects that marked the company's advancements in the fields of safety, sport performance, and design. The collection includes historic Dainese leather racing. Dainese Archivio has educational activities for schools and universities at its DAR Lab.[40][41] Dainese has sponsored racing from its earliest years. One of the first was 15-time World Champion Giacomo Agostini, who began racing in Dainese leathers in 1975.[42] Multiple World Championship winner Valentino Rossi is currently among the best-known racers to wear the brand colors.[43][44] Dainese has a network of 70 single-brand protective equipment specialist stores for motorcycling and dynamic sports across Europe, North America and Asia, and also sells direct to the public online through its official e-commerce website dainese.com. A new store concept designed by the Italian architect Renato Montagner was launched in 2017, conceived to also provide a meeting place for dynamic sports enthusiasts to meet and take part in special events and activities.[45] In 2019, Dainese launched the Dainese Experience project, a series of masterclasses, lessons, long journeys and weekends where customers can learn how to improve their sports performance.[46] ",

            "text": " Dallara Automobili is an Italian chassis manufacturer for various motor racing series, being most notable for its near-monopoly in Formula Three since 1993. Dallara also produces the chassis used by the IndyCar Series, Indy Lights, FIA Formula 2 Championship, World Series by Renault, GP3 Series, Super Formula, Formula E and ADAC Formel Masters and is one of the manufacturers in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series. In recent years their engineering activities have expanded considerably (now represents 40% of total sales), both in terms of the racing cars and high performance road cars. The company was founded by designer Gian Paolo Dallara in 1972 in Varano de' Melegari, near Parma, Italy, and started building chassis for sports car racing and hillclimbing, racing in the smaller engine classes. Dallara designed his first Formula Three car for Walter Wolf Racing in 1978. Dallara also had a brief involvement in Formula 3000 in the mid-1980s. The first F3 car under the Dallara name came in 1981, and the cars became particularly successful in Italy. Since 1985 Dallara drivers have taken the Italian Formula Three Championship every year except 1990. The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw Dallara make inroads into the German and French markets, winning the German title in 1987 and the French in 1987 and 1992. 1993 was the first year that Dallaras were entered in the British Formula Three Championship and was the beginning of the company's dominance of Formula Three. The new F393 featured major aerodynamic changes compared to its predecessor and introduced a monodamper front suspension layout. The F393 won every race in the Italian, French and German championships that year, while the British series saw numerous entrants \u2013 including champion Kelvin Burt \u2013 forced to switch from Reynard or Ralt chassis to Dallara in order to remain competitive. TOMS would win the Japanese championship with its own cars in 1993 and 1994 before switching to Dallara chassis. From then on Dallara would dominate the Formula Three market, although Martini had some success in France and Germany in the late 1990s, including S\u00e9bastien Bourdais winning the French title in 1999. Since then Dallara have won every major Formula Three title, although Ho-Pin Tung won the 2006 Recaro F3 Cup in a Lola against a field that included several current Dallaras. Dallaras have won the Macau Grand Prix since 1993. In 1988 the company became a Formula One constructor, after being hired by BMS Scuderia Italia to build their chassis. The relationship between the Italian constructor and Beppe Lucchini's racing outfit endured until 1992, with their best result being two third places: one at the 1989 Canadian Grand Prix with Andrea de Cesaris; the other at the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix, thanks to JJ Lehto. The Constructors' Championship results were: no classification in 1988, 8th in 1989 (with 8 points), 15th (with no points) in 1990, 8th in 1991 (with 5 points) and 10th in 1992 (with 2 points) by Pierluigi Martini. Dallara returned briefly to F1 in 1999, building the test-chassis for Honda's planned and aborted return to the series. During 2004, Dallara recruited ex-Jordan, Stewart and Jaguar F1 designer Gary Anderson, leading to speculation that the Italian company was working on another F1 project.  Late in 2004 the nascent Midland team announced that Dallara would be designing and building their Formula One chassis which was due to be entered for the 2006 season.  Following Midland's purchase of the Jordan team for early entry to F1 in 2005, Dallara continued co-operating with the team technically.  However, the relationship fizzled out as Midland focussed its resources on developing the existing Jordan infrastructure, and a new Dallara F1 chassis never appeared. Dallara built the cars for Hispania's entry in the 2010 season.[1] The Hispania team's financial problems\u2014which delayed payment of money owed to Dallara and the completion of the cars\u2014and the alleged low quality of the F110 chassis resulted in the two parties officially ending their partnership in May 2010. The car was used in all 2010 races without any development except the graphics. They had only one aerodynamic configuration, used for all races, including Monte Carlo and Monza.[2] Geoff Willis, who joined Hispania in March 2010, criticized the F110, saying that he was disappointed at the quality and level of engineering in the car and that the design of the car was missing a lot of practices commonly employed in the process of building a Formula One car those days.[3] On 15 April 2014 Gene Haas confirmed his new Formula One team, Haas F1 Team, had entered talks to form a partnership with Dallara in 2015 for the build of their first car.[4] On 21 February 2016, the Haas VF-16 was officially unveiled.[5] For the 2017 season, Haas once again had Dallara design their car, the VF-17.[6] Dallara debuted as chassis supplier at the IndyCar Series in 1997, and has been the single chassis supplier since 2007. The manufacturer has won seventeen of the twenty Indianapolis 500s they have contested. In 2013, Dallara reached its milestone 200th Indy car victory at Barber.[7] In 2012 the company opened an engineering center in Speedway, Indiana, at the Speed Zone Redevelopment Area near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where they produce and assemble the IndyCar. The same building also houses an entertainment center, where visitors can learn how a racing car is manufactured.[8] Dallara was one of the original three chassis constructors when the Indy Racing League debuted its own chassis formula during the 1997 season. The first model year (1997) was named the IR7. The cars were most notably differentiated from the competing G-Force chassis by the ovoid shape of the air intake inlet, while the G-Force's was triangular. The IR8 (1998) and IR9 (1999) were essentially 1997 model year chassis with update kits. Jim Guthrie won Dallara's first Indy car race at Phoenix on 23 March 1997.[7] Eddie Cheever won Dallara's first Indianapolis 500 in 1998. A new model chassis was introduced for the 2000 season. When updated for 2001 the chassis was designated as the IR-01 and for 2002 it was referred to as the IR-02. For the 2003 season, Dallara rolled out the new IR-03 chassis. This chassis would later become the de facto \"spec car\" in the series. An aerodynamic update kit was released for 2007, which changed its designation to IR-05. In addition, paddle shifters began seeing use in 2008, further developing and evolving this generation of Dallaras. Chassis bearing both the IR-03 and the IR-05 designations saw use through the end of the 2011 season. For the 2006 season, over 80% of the field began the season with a Dallara, a possible symptom of Panoz (manufacturer of the G-Force chassis)'s perceived lack of interest. This was around the time Panoz began delivering the DP01 chassis to the rival Champ Car series. From 2007 to 2011 all IndyCar teams used the Dallara IR-05 chassis, although a few teams entered a Panoz/G-Force chassis into the 2007 Indianapolis 500 singly. Some smaller teams continued to utilize the slightly older IR-03 designated chassis, particularly at Indianapolis, with update kits affixed to make it on equally competitive ground with the newer-assembled IR-05. Due to IndyCar IR-05 chassis and Honda Indy V8 engine development freeze for reason of focusing on 2012 new car from the start of the 2009 season, Dallara did not build new IndyCar chassis until the 2011 season. Starting in 2012, Dallara began providing the common monocoque and suspension parts for the new IndyCar formulae\u00a0\u2013 known as the IndyCar Safety Cell\u00a0\u2013 with the intent that the bodywork and aero parts can and will be provided by other manufacturers. The cars will be branded by the make who provides the \"Aero Kit.\" Dallara rolled out the chassis with its own optional spec aero kit. The aero kit concept was temporarily shelved due to cost concerns, making the Dallara kit the universal spec for 2012-2014. Unique aero kits (manufactured by Chevrolet and Honda, respectively) were introduced for 2015-2017, and Dallara ceased support and production of their own. Beginning in 2018, the third generation of aero kits will be introduced for the DW-12, again returning to a universal spec kit for all entries. On 18 October, Dallara confirmed that the 2012 series car would be named after the late IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon (DW12) in honour of his work testing the car before his death two days prior at Las Vegas, with the new bumper/nerf bar section being featured, it was designed to prevent many similar single-seater crashes such as the one that killed Wheldon.[9] In 2002, Dallara became the exclusive supplier for World Series by Nissan, a move that allowed them to gain the contract for the World Series by Renault in 2004. Dallara was also appointed by the FIA to be the sole supplier of the FIA Formula 2 Championship (formerly GP2 Series) and the new GP3 Series, giving them a near-monopoly of every motorsport series used as a direct entry point into F1. In 2007 Dallara created a new car model, known as the Formulino (\"little formula\"), in order to fill the gap between karts and Formula Three. The first series to use the new concept was the ADAC Formel Masters in 2008, and the MRF Challenge also adopted the car. Dallara has provided the spec chassis to the Indy Lights series, formerly the Infiniti/Indy Pro Series since 2002. For the 2015 Indy Lights season, the car was replaced by the new generation Dallara IL-15, powered by Mazda's 2.0-litre turbocharged MZR-R four-cylinder engine.[10]  In the early 1980s, Dallara was responsible for the construction of the Lancia LC1 Group 6 prototype as well as the later LC2 Group C car, along with Lancia's partner Abarth.  It would not be until 1993 that Dallara returned to endurance racing, although very few chassis would take their name. The first project was the Ferrari 333 SP, made for the new WSC regulations in the IMSA GT Championship. The 333 SP, manufactured at Michelotto, won a great number of races both in North America and Europe. Ferrari also hired Dallara to develop the racing version of the Ferrari F50, financed by French racing driver Fabien Giroix, but the project was aborted before it got off the ground, in 1998. As a consequence, the company secured other contracts and built chassis for Toyota (GT-One), Audi (various incarnations of the R8) and Chrysler (the Oreca-run Chrysler LMP).  Later, the Chrysler LMP would become Dallara's customer car available to privateers, known as the Dallara SP1, which has also served as a test mule for Nissan's aborted return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. All these cars were competitive in prototype sports car racing, with the Audi R8 in particular becoming the most dominant chassis in modern times at the 24 Hours and the American Le Mans Series. In 2002, they built the GC21 for use in the Fuji Grand Champion Series; the car was based on the company's F3 cars. In March 2008 the first Dallara Daytona Prototype appeared, built in collaboration with Doran for Wayne Taylor's SunTrust Racing team. In 2015 Dallara was named as one of four constructors for the new LMP2 and DPi class regulations to debut in 2017,[11] using its Dallara P217 chassis. In 2007, Dallara and KTM produced the KTM X-Bow, a sports car with two seats, which was shown in its final version at the Bologna Motor Show.[citation needed] Dallara also provided engineering services for Renault (R.S. 01), Alfa Romeo (8C and 4C), Audi (DTM and LeMans series), Bugatti (Veyron and Chiron), Ferrari, Porsche, and Maserati (MC12).[citation needed] In 2017, Dallara showed its first road car, the Stradale, on the occasion of Gian Paolo Dallara's 81st birthday.[12] For the Rosetta probe Dallara designed the drill that is part of the Philae robotic lander. Dallara has also partnered with Raytheon to provide the MALD for the United States Air Force.[13][14] (key) (results in bold indicate pole position) ",

The company uses celebrity endorsements to market its products. In the early 2000s the company had a dispute with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston regarding the use of their names and wedding ring designs. The dispute was settled for $50 million and the couple helped Damiani create and market a line of products.[citation needed] Damiani expanded across Asia and the US. It went public in 2007. Its most well-known jewelry product brands are Salvini, Alfieri & St. John and Bliss. Damiani was founded in 1924 by Enrico Grassi Damiani, in Valenza, Italy. It became popular among affluent Italians.[5] Damiani's son led the company from 1960-1990.[6] It started selling products on the US market in 2001 and introduced a $2.5 million ad campaign the following year.[7] Damiani experienced negative press[7] after Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston filed a lawsuit. They said Damiani was selling reproductions of the ring custom-designed by Brad Pitt and made exclusively for their wedding in violation of their agreement with Damiani.[7] Damiani said they never made that agreement and that the rings were merely chosen from a collection of wedding rings.[8] A settlement was reached for $50 million in January 2002. As part of the settlement, Mr Pitt designed a ring for Damiani, which Aniston would model in its advertisements for it.[9][10] By 2003 it had 25 stores which each sold a single brand of products, in Italy, Asia and the US.[11] In 2007, Damiani announced an initial public offering, which valued the company at \u20ac150.8 million (USD$215.4 million) (in 2007 exchange rates).[12] Rocca S.p.A., an Italian jewelry and watch retailer, was purchased by Damiani for \u20ac7 million (US$9.81 million) in 2008[3] In 2010, Damiani had a net loss of \u20ac18.2 million (USD$25.6 million).[13] The company's estimated total sales (in 2010/2011) were \u20ac150 million.[14] In 2010, Birks & Mayors agreed to distribute all Damiani Group's brands, for five years, in the United States.[citation needed] In 2012, Damiani entered into a partnership with MingFung/Hengdeli Group to distribute its watches and jewelry in China.[15] Also, in 2012, Damiani received permission by the Government of India to invest in the Indian jewelry market.[16] As of November 2012, Damiani had an annual revenue of \u20ac151.6 million (USD$193.3 million).[17] In the fiscal year ending March 2013, Damiani S.P.A. had sales of \u20ac137.82 million (USD$185.75 million)[1] Currently, Damiani is run by the third generation of the Damiani family,[18] that has been on the board of directors since 1996.[17] In 2012, the company became the first jeweler to obtain the authorization to hold a 51% controlling interest in an Indian-based entity, Damiani India.[17] In November 2013, Damiani raised funds for the Italian Red Cross to support people affected by the storms in Sardinia by donating 20 percent of certain sales in Damiani\u2019s flagship stores in Italy and watch retailer Rocca.[19] The President Guido Damiani received the America Award of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2013. Damiani designs and markets jewelry and watches, as well as jewels and unique pieces.[20] The company's major market is in Italy. It is sold in other major markets worldwide through subsidiaries and boutiques.[21] It has won 18 consecutive Diamonds International Awards.[5] All Damiani suppliers are part of a restricted circle of selected organizations respecting UN regulations on the certification and origin of conflict-free diamonds.[5] There are 35 retail boutiques and 19 other franchises such as jewelry stores.[22] The main brands of Damiani are:[23][24] Damiani collaborates with celebrities like Isabella Rossellini, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to promote their products.[26][27] Gwyneth Paltrow was featured in its ads in 2004.[26] Damiani created the \"Aro Necklace, which Aro, a leader of the Volturi ruling vampire clan,\" in the Twilight movie, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2, gives to Bella Swan.[28] It also created the 2009 Harlequin Fantasy Bra, worn by model Marisa Miller during the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show.[29] The bra has an 18k gold frame with 2,355 colorless and cognac diamonds, with a focal point of a 16-carat, champagne-color, heart-shape diamond, for a total of nearly 150 carats total weight.[29] ",

The company is based in Buttrio, in the north-east of Italy (Friuli-Venezia-Giulia region). It has more than 25 divisions worldwide (design, manufacturing and service centers), 7 of which are Production Centers (Italy, Russia, Austria, Germany, India, China, Thailand). Danieli\u2019s origins date to 1914 when two brothers Mario and Timo Danieli founded the Angelini Steelworks in Brescia, Italy, one of the first companies to use the electric arc furnace for steel making.[1] In 1929 part of the steelworks was transferred to Buttrio to manufacture tools for forging plants and auxiliary machines for rolling mills. In 1955, led by Luigi Danieli, the company started designing and manufacturing equipment for the steel industry. His idea was to manufacture more competitive equipment, simplify layouts and maximize the use of automation. One of the concepts developed, the \"EAF/Conticaster-Rolling mill\" production route, has characterized and contributed to the successful development of the minimill process,which is widely adopted today.[citation needed] In 1982 the company was listed on the Milan Stock Exchange, and in 1984 Cecilia Danieli\u00a0[it] (who had managed the financial and administrative departments of the Group since 1977) - who was appointed Chairman - and Gianpietro Benedetti (who had been Technological, Commercial and Project execution director since 1977) - who was appointed CEO - were entrusted with the management of the company. Since then Danieli has acquired German (Josef Fr\u00f6hling), Swedish (Morg\u00e5rdshammar), British (Davy Distington), French (Rotelec), American (Wean Industries, United Engineering), and Dutch (Corus Technical Services) companies. At the end of the 1990s the internationalization process was completed with the construction of production centers in China, Thailand, Vietnam and India, followed by Russia, Turkey and Brazil, all of which were added to the European plants already existing in Italy, Sweden and Germany. Beginning in 1969, through Danieli Automation, the company developed its own automation systems, including instrumentation and power control technologies. In 2005 the company started a transformation program and expanded into developing countries by establishing fully owned and directly managed design and production centers. In 1995 Danieli acquired a local steelmaking company, ABS, which is also used as a laboratory for metallurgy, equipment, processes and their related automation. ",

He was widely considered to be one of the great contemporary steel and aluminum bicycle framebuilders and a pioneer of lugless TIG welded frames.[2] Pegoretti used only steel and aluminum to create his frames, primarily using drawn tubes (including custom shapes based on his specifications and designs)  from Excell, Dedacciai, and most recently Columbus. His most recent models included the Responsorium, Day is Done, Big Leg Emma, Mxxxxxo, Duende, Luigino, Love #3, and 8:30AM.[3] He apprenticed with master Italian framebuilder Luigino Milani,[4] who was also his father-in-law.[5][6][7] Pegoretti designed and built frames that were ridden by professional cyclists Miguel Indurain, Marco Pantani, Stephen Roche, Claudio Chiappucci, Mario Cipollini, and Andrea Tafi among others.[2][8]  He started out as a contract builder, making frames that were then branded by other manufacturers, including some Pinarello models, until the American distributor Giorgio Andretta/GITA[9] convinced him to build under his own name.[2] Floyd Landis owns and rides a Love #3.  He supplied comedian Robin Williams with bikes that the actor regularly used and particularly admired; and Williams also gave them as gifts.[10][11][12] Pegoretti also created custom paint and graphics designs for customers. The 'ciavate' paint scheme is entirely hand-painted by Dario and originally drew inspiration from Jean-Michel Basquiat.[2][6][13] His work was highly creative, inventive, and very influenced by his deep love of music. His frame model names and graphic often included references to and/or quotations of his favorite musical and prose pieces. In addition to running his framebuilding studio, Mr. Pegoretti was also a respected teacher, and lectured and taught seminars at various design schools.[14][15][16][17] Dario Pegoretti's famous slogan was \"fatti con le  mani\" (\"made by hand\") and he lived this motto completely. He constantly combined aspects of art, craft, and creativity, of the highest order and as very few if any bicycle framebuilders ever have. In 2007, Pegoretti was diagnosed with lymphoma but had recovered.[10] On 23 August 2018 Dario Pegoretti died of heart failure at approximately 19:00 hours in Verona, Italy.[18][19][20][21] Pegoretti won the President's Choice award at the 2007 North American Handmade Bicycle Show[22] and framebuilder of the year at the 2008 show.[23] ",

Company founder Ugo De Rosa was born on January 27, 1934 in Milan, Italy. Before becoming a noted bicycle frame builder, he was also an amateur racer.[1] De Rosa's passion for racing led him to study mechanics and engineering at a technical college, and in the early 1950s he opened his first shop and commenced the manufacture of racing bicycles. In 1958 he was asked by the famous cyclist Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani to build him a bike for the upcoming Giro d'Italia.[2]  Following on from this initial interest, De Rosa bikes became a fixture in the professional peloton of the 1960s. The Faema team was the first team to ride De Rosa frames. Other De Rosa teams of the decade included Tbac (1964) and Max Majer (1967). In 1969 De Rosa was approached by Gianni Motta, who wanted to engage De Rosa as his frame builder and mechanic. De Rosa accepted and became the bicycle supplier to Motta's team as well.  It was during this period that one of the greatest stars of cycling was rising - Eddy Merckx. DeRosa built some frames for Merckx around this time, but it was not until 1973 that their relationship was formalized and De Rosa became the official frame builder and mechanic for the Molteni team which he captained.  Merckx and his teammates won nearly all the major European races including the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, Milan\u2013San Remo and the World Championship. This partnership with Molteni remained in effect until Merckx's retirement in 1978. In 1981 De Rosa worked as technical consultant to Merckx, who began his own bicycle manufacturing company. In 1974 Francesco Moser engaged De Rosa for his Filotex team, and went on to win the World Championship. Later, in 1982 De Rosa sponsored the Sammontana team led by Moreno Argentin and Giovanbattista Baronchelli.  From 1985 to 1989 De Rosa worked with the Ariostea team - a small start-up team which would later become dominant in European racing. Demand for De Rosa bicycles from new markets skyrocketed in the 1980s - including the United States, Russia, Japan, Belgium, and Germany. Subsequently, De Rosa's company outgrew the small workshop adjacent to his home, and moved to a larger space in Cusano Milanino. Later, his three sons entered the business, with Danilo and Doriano assisting in production management, and Cristiano taking over the commercial side of the business. In 1990 Ugo De Rosa began research and development in titanium tubing, culminating in a new model, the De Rosa Titanio, used by the Gewiss\u2013Ballan team in 1994.[3] Aluminium and carbon fiber   frames were added to the product line in 1996 and 2000 respectively. In 2005 De Rosa launched its Corum frame, a lightweight steel frame built using contemporary frame building techniques. On December 10, 2007, it was announced that the UCI Continental team, Team LPR would be riding De Rosa bicycles for the upcoming season.  UCI Continental team Rock Racing rode De Rosa bicycles up until the end of 2008. ",

            "text": " De Tomaso Automobili (previously known as De Tomaso Modena SpA) is an Italian car-manufacturing company. It was founded by the Argentine-born Alejandro de Tomaso (1928\u20132003) in Modena in 1959. It originally produced various prototypes and racing cars, including a Formula One car for Frank Williams's team in 1970. Most of the funding for the automaker came from de Tomaso's brother-in-law, Amory Haskell Jr, Rowan Industries. In 1971, Ford acquired an 84% stake in De Tomaso from Rowan with Alejandro de Tomaso himself holding the balance.[5] Ford would sell back their stake in the automaker in 1974 to Alejandro. The De Tomaso brand was acquired in 2014 by Hong-Kong based Ideal Team Ventures and in 2019, the newly formed company presented their first product, a retro-styled sports car called the P72.[1] The blue and white stripes of the logo's background are the colors of the national flag of Argentina. The symbol in the foreground that looks like a letter \"T\" is the cattle branding symbol of the Ceballos estate where Alejandro grew up.[6] The company went on to develop and produce both sports cars and luxury vehicles, most notably the Ford-powered Italian-bodied  Mangusta and Pantera grand tourers. From 1976 to 1993 De Tomaso owned Italian sports car maker Maserati, and was responsible for producing cars including the Biturbo, the Kyalami, Quattroporte III, Karif, and the Chrysler TC. De Tomaso also owned motorcycle company Moto Guzzi from 1973 to 1993. De Tomaso went into liquidation in 2004,[7] although production of new cars continued after this date.[8] By 2008 a buyer was being sought for the De Tomaso factory and trademarks, as per the court-appointed liquidators.[9] In 2009 Gian Mario Rossignolo bought the De Tomaso trademark and founded a new company named De Tomaso Automobili SpA. Rossignolo planned to assemble chassis and bodies in one of Delphi Automotive's old production facilities in Livorno and to fit bodywork, paint and finish its cars in the former Pininfarina factory in Grugliasco.[10] In May 2012, De Tomaso was again for sale after their business plan failed to gather sufficient financial backing.[11] In July 2012,  Rossignolo was arrested following allegations that he misused \u20ac7,500,000 worth of government funds.[12] In September 2012, speculation emerged that BMW might be interested in the brand factory to produce new BMW models.[13] In 2014 the original workshop in Modena was in abandonment.[14] In April 2015, an Italian bankruptcy court approved the sale of the company to Hong-Kong based Consolidated Ideal Team Ventures, for \u20ac1,050,000.[15] Per that sale report \"A lawyer for the buyer announced that Ideal Team Venture plans to produce cars in China bearing the De Tomaso name.\"[15] De Tomaso's first road-going production model was the Vallelunga (named after the racing circuit) introduced in 1963.  This mid-engined sports car had a 104\u00a0bhp (78\u00a0kW) Ford Cortina engine, and reached a top speed of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph). It had an aluminium backbone chassis, which was to become a common feature of De Tomaso cars. The first 5 cars were produced in aluminium while production cars had fibreglass bodywork. The Mangusta, introduced in 1966 was the first De Tomaso produced in significant numbers. With the Mangusta, De Tomaso moved from European to American Ford engines.  The car had a 4.7-litre iron-block V8 engine and steel and aluminium coup\u00e9 bodywork from Ghia\u2014an Italian coachbuilder also controlled by Alejandro de Tomaso. About 400 Mangustas were built before production ended in 1971. The Mangusta was succeeded by the Pantera. It appeared in 1971 with a 351 Cleveland Ford V8 and a low, wedge-shaped body designed by Ghia's Tom Tjaarda.[16] Through an agreement with Ford, De Tomaso sold Panteras in the USA through Ford's Lincoln and Mercury dealers. Between 1971 and 1973, 6,128 Panteras were produced in Modena, the largest number of a single marque of De Tomaso produced. The 1973 oil crisis and other factors compelled Ford to pull out of the Pantera deal at the end of 1973, a few months after buying all De Tomaso's shares and getting control of the entire production process in the three factories that shared the workload in northern Italy.[17] But the Argentinian retained from Ford the right to produce the car for the \"rest of the world\" market, so he continued Pantera production at a greatly reduced scale of less than 100 cars per year during the 1970s and 1980s. From then on, the cars were largely hand-built, even more than before.[18] Incorporating a Marcello Gandini facelift, suspension redesign, partial chassis redesign and a new, smaller Ford engine, the Pantera 90 Si model (the i standing for iniezione - Italian for fuel injection) was introduced in 1990. There were 41 90 Si models manufactured with 2 crash tested, 38 sold, and 1 example went directly into a museum[19] before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical, carbon-fibre-bodied Guar\u00e0. The Guar\u00e0 succeeded the Pantera and began production in 1993. The Guar\u00e0 was designed by Carlo Gaino of Synthesis design,[20] an Italian design house; Gaino also designed the Maserati Barchetta.[21] Based on a Maserati competition car from 1991, using Ford and BMW parts in a composite body, the Guar\u00e0 s available in coup\u00e9 and barchetta versions. As with all De Tomasos except the Pantera, production has been both limited and sporadic. In the early 2000s two other cars were planned by De Tomaso, but both proved abortive. A two-seat Gandini-styled convertible, the Bigu\u00e0, was developed from a 1996 Geneva concept in partnership with Qvale, an American firm which had long imported European sports cars into the USA. But as production of the Bigu\u00e0\u2014renamed the Mangusta\u2014began, the relationship between De Tomaso and Qvale soured; Qvale took over the car and rebadged it as the Qvale Mangusta. Production was short-lived, and Qvale's Italian factory was bought in 2003 by MG Rover and the Mangusta's mechanicals were then used as the basis of the MG XPower SV. In April 2002, De Tomaso began a project to build off-road vehicles in a new factory in Calabria in partnership with the Russian company UAZ, but this too floundered. The deal projected a production rate of 10,000 cars a year by 2006: however, no cars were built and De Tomaso went into voluntary liquidation in June 2004 after the death of Alejandro de Tomaso in 2003. The Guar\u00e0 remained available in some markets in 2005 and 2006, but it appears that no cars were built after 2004.[22] The P72 is a retro-styled sports car introduced at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed under the newly reformed DeTomaso brand. Designed by Jowyn Wong, the car is a homage to the P70, a race car built by Carrol Shelby and styled by Peter Brock for De Tomaso introduced the late 1960s. The design of the car is meant to be hailing back to the LeMans race cars of 1960s. The interior of the car is meant to have a modern outlook with opulent instrumentation. The chassis built to LMP1 standards is shared with the sister company Apollo Automobil's Intensa Emozione. Although De Tomaso is principally known as a maker of high-performance sports cars, the firm also produced luxury coup\u00e9s and saloons in tiny number throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The 1971 Deauville was an effort to rival contemporary Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz saloons. With the same engine as the Pantera mounted in the front, the Deauville was clothed in an angular  Tjaarda/Ghia four-door body. The Deauville did not compete with its rivals, especially those from Germany, on the perspective of build quality. Despite remaining on De Tomaso's offerings until 1985, only 244 were ever made. A single example of an estate was built for Alejandro de Tomaso's wife, the American racing driver Isabelle Haskell.[23] In 1972 De Tomaso introduced a coup\u00e9 based on the Deauville with a slightly shortened Deauville chassis and the same Ford V8 engine, called the Longchamp. Its body design, however, was substantially different, and influenced by the Lancia Marica prototype, also designed by Tom Tjaarda.[citation needed] A total of 409 cars of all variations were built by the time the production ended in 1989. With the assistance of the Italian government, De Tomaso took over Maserati in 1976 after its owner, Citro\u00ebn, declared that it would no longer support the loss-making company. The first Maserati De Tomaso introduced, the Kyalami, was a Longchamp redesigned by Frua, with the Ford engine replaced by Maserati's own 4.2-litre V8. The Kyalami remained in production until 1983, when it was superseded by the Biturbo, introduced two years earlier. Other cars Introduced under the De Tomaso ownership included the Quattroporte III/Royale and IV, the Barchetta, the Ghibli and the Shamal. All of the latter cars other than the Quattroporte III were based on the Biturbo while the Quattroporte was based on the Kyalami platform. De Tomaso introduced this concept of platform sharing to save development costs on new models. In 1993, De Tomaso sold Maserati to Fiat SpA due to slumping sales and low profitability. In 1976, Innocenti passed to Alejandro de Tomaso and was reorganised by the De Tomaso Group under the name Nuova Innocenti. From 1976 to 1987 the top of the range Innocenti was the Innocenti Mini de Tomaso, a sport version of the Innocenti Mini developed by De Tomaso, initially equipped with the BLMC 1275 cc engine, and from 1982 to 1987 with a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder turbocharged Daihatsu engine. De Tomaso sold Innocenti to Fiat in 1993. In 2009 the De Tomaso trademark was bought by Former Fiat executive Gian Mario Rossignolo who founded a new company named De Tomaso Automobili SpA. A new business plan for the company called for producing three models for a total of 8,000 vehicles: 3,000 crossovers, 3,000 limousines, and 2,000 two-seater sports cars. At the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, De Tomaso presented a new model.[24] The new De Tomaso Deauville was to have been a five-door hatchback/crossover vehicle with all-wheel drive, which, in the details of its styling, quotes models from BMW and Mercedes-Benz.[25] The proposed range included two gasoline engines with 300 PS and 500 PS as well as a diesel from VM Motori with 250 PS. The Deauville remained a prototype, as the new company never started production and the company chairman, Rossignolo, was arrested in 2012 on account of misappropriation of funds taken from the Italian government to revive the De Tomaso brand. As a result, 900 employees of the company were made redundant.[26] Rossignolo was sentenced to five and a half years of imprisonment on the charges of fraud and embezzlement in 2018.[27] The rights to the De Tomaso brand were acquired by Norman Choi of Ideal Team Ventures in 2014. The new management under Choi's leadership undertook the task of reviving the brand. Five years later, the company unveiled its first product, the P72 retro-styled sports car at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, at the time of 60th anniversary of the De Tomaso brand. The car had been in development under the code name of \"Project P\". The new car is based on the Apollo Intensa Emozione's monocoque chassis, a car manufactured by De Tomaso's sister company Apollo Automobil and 72 units of the car will be sold.[28] De Tomaso made a handful of Formula One appearances from 1961 to 1963, with their own chassis and a mix of engines. During 1962 the De Tomaso 801 appeared, with an original 135-degree 1498\u00a0cc V8 with a claimed 200\u00a0CV (147\u00a0kW) at 9500\u00a0rpm, and a six-speed De Tomaso transmission (although presumably developed by Valerio Colotti). The stubby and somewhat unaerodynamic design of the car raised some questions among period writers, as did the claimed max power.[29] The De Tomaso 801 was entered in a number of races but only appeared once, at the 1962 Italian Grand Prix, where it failed to qualify. De Tomaso then built a Formula One chassis (designed by Gian Paolo Dallara) for Frank Williams Racing Cars to use in the 1970 Formula One season. The car was uncompetitive, failing to finish the first four races of the year. In the fifth, the Dutch Grand Prix, the De Tomaso 505/38 flipped and caught fire, killing driver Piers Courage. The team persevered, first with Brian Redman, then Tim Schenken. However, with no results, the partnership was dissolved at the end of the season. (key) ",

The company was founded by the De' Longhi family in 1902 as a small industrial parts manufacturing workshop. The company incorporated in 1950. Historically a major producer of portable heaters and air conditioners, the company has expanded to include nearly every category of small domestic appliances in the food preparation and cooking, as well as household cleaning and ironing, segments. De'Longhi is especially well known for the Artista Series espresso machines, the De'Longhi gelato maker and the Pinguino portable air conditioner. De'Longhi is known for the design of its products. Its Esclusivo line of kitchen appliances won the Red Dot design award in 2007.[3] Home Furnishing News recognized De'Longhi Design Director Giocomo Borin as one of the 50 most influential designers in the world in 2006. De'Longhi's 2000 acquisition of Climaveneta SpA and DLRadiators allowed De'Longhi to enter the commercial HVACR (Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning and Refrigeration) market. De'Longhi's \u00a345.9 million[4] (about $66.7 million) 2001 acquisition of the British appliance maker Kenwood gave De'Longhi access to Kenwood's Chinese factory. As a result, many of De'Longhi's products are now imported from China, while design and engineering remain largely in Italy. Acquisition of a majority stake in RC Group, a leading player in information technology cooling, in 2006 has strengthened De'Longhi's presence in the HVACR market. In all, De'Longhi operates 13 production facilities and 30 international subsidiaries that support sales to 75 countries worldwide. International sales account for nearly 75 percent of the group's total revenues, which topped \u20ac1.63 billion in 2010. On 2 January 2012 the DeLclima group was set up as a demerger from De'Longhi. On 16 April 2012, De'Longhi bought perpetual rights to manufacture Braun branded products from Procter & Gamble in the small appliance segment. Procter & Gamble will continue to own the Braun brand.  \u20ac50 million was paid immediately and \u20ac90 million will be paid over the next 15 years.[2] Shares in the company are traded on Milan's stock exchange. In October 2017, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America and Allergy Standards Limited announced that five  De'Longhi dehumidifiers have earned the Asthma and Allergy Friendly Certification. These are the first dehumidifiers to receive the program\u2019s mark.[5] ",

The company's products are suitable for being transported by car, boat, or airplane, and are designed and manufactured entirely in-house. The founder of the company, Rosario Di Blasi, began development of a folding scooter in 1952, which by 1968 had evolved into a Zanetti-powered folding tricycle called the DIBLA 7 that was shown at the Turin Auto Show as a prototype. Finally in 1974 Di Blasi began production of a folding moped with a Franco Morini motor and single-speed transmission called the R2 (also known as the \"Paperino\"). In 1979 the model R7 replaced the R2 and featured an engine of Di Blasi's own design as well as a multi-speed transmission. This moped has been continuously improved and is still in production as the R7E. It has been used by the Polizia Stradale, the Traffic Police division of the Italian National Police, aboard their helicopters.[1][2] The R7 is sold by Di Blasi of America as the \"Express.\"[3] It is also used worldwide by a number of different \"chauffeur\" companies, who will drive it to meet the customer, fold it up and put it in the trunk of their car, and drive the customer wherever they need to go, such as home from a bar or party. One such company, Superbob, serves part of the Netherlands.[4] In the southern US, Zingo Transportation provides this service. In Australia the Di Blasi R7 has been imported, sold and run as part of their designated chauffeur service by Scoot2you Personal Chauffeurs originally on the Gold Coast and then in Brisbane and Melbourne and shortly in Sydney as part of their growing Franchise. Also in 1974, the company introduced a folding bicycle called the Avia. The model Avia is notable for having featured the first folding pedals ever developed.[1] The Avia evolved into the model R20 (1980), R50 (1984), R6 (1991), R4 (1995), R5, R21 (20-inch wheels), R24, and the R22. This bicycle series has characteristically been one of the most compact and easily  folding bicycles on the market.[5][6] The company has also produced folding pedal tricycles since 2000: the R31, R32, and R34.

Diadora is an Italian athletic footwear and apparel manufacturer, a tradition that began in 1948 when the company's founder, Marcello Danieli, first began working in the trade as a young boy. He called his company \"Diadora\" a name suggested by a friend. In Greek, \"dia dora\" means \"by means of gifts\" which was appropriate, but probably not the origin of his friend's suggestion. More likely, it came from the name given by the Greeks of Byzantium to the Dalmatian town of Zadar. Originally called \"de ladera\" or \"from Zadar,\" it was mistakenly copied and translated from Dalmatian to Latin, becoming, along the way \"Diadora.\"[1] Danieli, helped by his wife, managed to successfully launch his first product, mountain climbing boots.[2] During the 1950s, a reputation for excellence and quality helped the company grow and become a familiar name throughout the Italian market. During the economic boom of the 1960s, people began to enjoy prosperity and increased recreation. Skiing became popular and Danieli once again met the needs of the market by manufacturing ski boots and the first apres-ski boots. Next, Diadora introduced running shoes and shortly thereafter, tennis shoes. With the 1970s came a young generation whose explosive interest in athletics initiated a boom in the sporting goods industry. Based originally on the renowned Italian artisan techniques, Diadora's shoes became more and more technologically advanced, thanks to cooperation from champions such as Guillermo Vilas, Martin Mulligan and Bj\u00f6rn Borg. The mid-'70s also marked Diadora's entry into the football category, aided by Roberto Bettega, who both provided invaluable consulting information. Diadora America is the #3 brand in the market share in football (soccer). AC Milan striker Marco van Basten became the face of the company in the late 1980s, and launched his own personalized football boots, the San Siro Van Basten.[3] Diadora had and currently have a number of other high-profile football players under their sponsorship such as; George Weah, Roberto Baggio, Giuseppe Signori, Francesco Totti, Roy Keane and Antonio Cassano. On 30 June 1998, Invicta, an outdoor athletics equipment company, was acquired by Diadora. In 2007, Diadora signed a contract with football club NK Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia. Sheffield Wednesday F.C. wore kits for several seasons in the mid 2000s. Maccabi Netanya and Beitar Jerusalem also wore kits for several seasons in the mid to late 2000s.[4][5] In 2016, Diadora signed contracts with FK \u017deljezni\u010dar and Collingwood Magpies Netball.[6][7] in January of 2018 signed with Vasco da Gama one two most popular clubs of Brazil. In 2008, Diadora SpA signed a joint venture with Win Hanverky Holdings Limited forming a new company called Winor International Company Limited that owns the trademark \"DIADORA\" in China, Hong Kong, and Macau and will manufacture, design, promote, distribute, and sell products bearing the \"DIADORA\" in those countries.[8] In June 2009, Diadora reached an agreement with Italian shoe-making company Geox's founder and chairman Mario Moretti Polegato to buy its assets through his family's investment arm, LIR.[9] Excludes articles found in Category:Sportswear brands.

The clothing line has two different brands: Diesel and Diesel Black Gold. There is also a line for children, called Diesel Kid. The company is known for its surreal advertising campaigns.  The Diesel  branded luxury fragrance line  is owned and produced by L'Or\u00e9al. Diesel USA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2019.[4][5][6][7] Its parent company, Diesel SpA, is not part of the bankruptcy filing. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso began stitching jeans on a sewing machine at the age of fifteen. He used his mother\u2019s sewing machine to produce low-riding, bell bottomed jeans, which he would wear himself and sell to his friends for 3500 lira a piece. He later attended an industrial textile manufacturing high school in Padua.[8] In 1976 Rosso began working for a clothing manufacturer called Moltex, which was owned by Adriano Goldschmied. After working with the company for two years, he used a loan from his father to buy a 40% holding in the company, which changed its name to Diesel, and marketed jeans under the Diesel brand and many others.[9] Rosso bought out Goldschmied's interest in the Diesel brand name in 1985 for US$500,000, becoming the sole owner of the company.[9] Rosso has said that he learned marketing from the US, creativity from Italy, and systems from Germany.[10] In 1990 Russ Togs, Inc. received the license to market and distribute Diesel lines in the United States and Mexico. Mitsubishi Co. received the license to market and distribute in Japan.[11] By 1991, Russ Togs was going out of business, and sold Diesel Sportswear to Rosso upon ending the licensing deal. As a result of Russ Togs collapse, the creation of made in the USA Diesel products never came to fruition, and Diesel instead placed its made-in-Italy jeans and clothing in US stores.[12] In 1992, Diesel became the title sponsor for the World Superbike racing circuit.[13] In 1995, Diesel launched one of the first significant fashion retail websites, which housed images of each of its collections. The first Diesel jeans to be sold online were available in Finland and Sweden starting in 1997. It then opened a virtual store that allowed home delivery for further markets the following year.[14] In 1996, Diesel opened large flagship stores in New York City, San Francisco, Rome, and London, and began to open other mono-brand stores for Diesel in order to augment its points of sale in department and other multi-brand retails stores. Further flagship stores (also known as \u201cStyleLabs\u201d) opened, including stores in Berlin, Barcelona, and Paris.[15] Diesel also produces illustrated catalogs for its retail lines.[16] The company also won the Premio Risultati award for Best Italian Company of the Year from the Bocconi Institute in 1996.[17] In 1998 The Wall Street Journal called Diesel \u201cthe label of the moment\u201d. Diesel founder Rosso began purchasing additional fashion companies in 2002, under the parent company Only The Brave, which Diesel was brought under as well. Companies purchased by Only the Brave included Maison Martin Margiela, Viktor & Rolf, Marni, and licensing company Staff International.[18] In 2005 Diesel released the book \u201cFifty\u201d upon Rosso\u2019s fiftieth birthday, an illustrated history of the company, with a print-run of ten thousand.[19] Diesel's denim's products are produced exclusively in Italy, with many of its products produced by out-sourced factories. Its headquarters are in Breganze, on the former Moto Laverda factory area, and had twelve international subsidiaries as of 2005.[16] As of 2008, the company had five thousand points of sale across eighty countries, with 270 mono-brand Diesel stores. Diesel itself owns 170 of those, with the rest owned by franchisees.[20] Turnover was over \u20ac1.3 billion in 2009,[10] and by 2010 the company had over 400 stores. In 2012 Diesel founder Rosso was listed on the Forbes list of billionaires for the first time.[21]  In 2015 the company held the exhibition Welcome to Diesel World in Shanghai, which provided an overview of the company\u2019s history, in conjunction with its collection debut.[22] Another exhibition was held in Tel Aviv to mark the company\u2019s twentieth year in Israel.[23] While the most popular Diesel apparel item has been denim wear, the company has expanded to include additional forms of clothing. The company has created leather jackets, women\u2019s dresses, and other items.[24] In 1998, Diesel founded an offshoot label called Diesel StyleLab, which produced higher end fashion designs beyond more traditional denim jeans.[25] In the 2000s, the company began to license its brand to other retail manufacturers, in order to create new product categories. These lines included the sunglasses line Diesel Eyewear in partnership with Marcolin, the jewels and watches line Diesel Watches in partnership with Fossil,[26] the fragrance line in partnership with L'Or\u00e9al.[27] The production of each line involves supervision from Diesel itself.[14] Diesel has also partnered with Moroso, Seletti, Scavolini, Foscarini, and Berti to create a home furnishings line called Diesel Living,[28] with Bugaboo to create strollers,[29] with AVG to create helmets,[30] with Ducati,[31] and with Fiat to create a limited edition Fiat 500.[32] Diesel also produces limited edition lines of jeans.[33] As of 2003, according to Women\u2019s Wear Daily, Diesel had three distinct fashion lines, \u201cDiesel Style Lab, the most pricey fashion-forward designer label; Diesel, a fashion brand that still focuses heavily on denim, and 55DSL, the board sport-inspired streetwear line that blends fashion and function.\u201d[34] Style Lab and 55DSL are now defunct. Currently there are two lines at Diesel: Diesel and Diesel Black Gold.[35] Diesel Black Gold is the luxury ready-to-wear line and was launched in 2008 during the New York Fashion Week.[36] That year the company also partnered with Adidas to co-produce a sport denim line.[37] In 2013 Diesel underwent a re-branding effort, reorganizing both the business structure and marketing methodologies.[18] Starting in 1991,[16] Diesel has been known for producing ads that invoke surreal images in lieu of direct product details, in partnership with Swedish ad agency Paradiset DDB, Stockholm. These included 1997 ads portraying life in Communist North Korea (shot in Hong Kong).[38] Another ad campaign imitated automobile crashes.[39] Campaigns have also used social consciousness as a theme, ironic plays on global issues (such as their Global Warming Ready campaign featuring post-global warming backdrops in global locations), as well as anti-establishment messages.[40][41][42] Michael Chevalier has critiqued the retail stores, stating that he believes that the stores's merchandise is presented in a confusing way in order to get customers to interact with the sales staff.[43] During the late 1990s, Diesel produced CD-ROMs and other computer content, including the computer game \u201cDigital Adrenalin\u201455DSL\u201d.[14] In 2007 Diesel sponsored a music contest, Diesel-U-Music.[44] From January to September 2008, Diesel spent $5.8 million on U.S. advertising, according to TNS Media Intelligence.[45] The Grand Prix award at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival was won by Diesel in 1997,[25] in 2001 for a campaign featuring the fictitious newspaper \u201cThe Daily African\u201d,[9] and for the ad campaign \u201cBe Stupid\u201d in 2010.[46] There is a Diesel Art Gallery in Tokyo.[47] In 2009 the head of Diesel's US division, Steve Birkhold, left the company shortly after agreeing a deal to sell cut-priced jeans through Macy's.[48] In 2015 Liam Hemsworth appeared in an ad for Only The Brave.[49] Winnie Harlow also appeared in ads that year as well.[50] ",

In 1982, they established a designer consulting studio; in time it grew to become \"Dolce & Gabbana\". They presented their first women's collection in 1985[5] in Milan, where a year later their store would open its doors. In 1988, they launched a leotard line, and in 1989 they began designing underwear and swimming costumes. Dolce & Gabbana started to export their products to Japan and other countries including the United States, where they founded their own showroom in 1990. In 1992, the same year they presented their men's collection, they also launched their first perfume Dolce & Gabbana. They won the Woolmark award in 1991, and Perfume's Academy \"Most Feminine Flavor of the Year\" in 1993 for their fragrance Dolce & Gabbana Parfum. By the end of the 1990s, the company's revenues were around US$500\u00a0million and in 2003 their revenue reached $633\u00a0million. By 2005, their turnover was \u20ac600 million.[6] The first collection from the design duo was shown in October 1985[5][7] alongside five other up-and-coming Italian labels as part of Milan Fashion Week. The two did not have enough money to hire models or provide accessories for them, so they sought help from their friends. The models (their friends) simply wore their personal items to complement the clothing. They used a bed sheet that Dolce had brought from home as their stage curtain.[8] The pair labeled their first collection Real Women, due in part to the use of local women as models on the runway.[7] Sales from their first collection were disappointing enough for Gabbana to cancel the fabric order they'd put in to create their second collection. However, Dolce's family offered to help meet their costs when the two visited them in Sicily over Christmas, while incidentally, the fabric company did not receive the cancellation notice in time so the fabric was ready for them back in Milan upon their return.[9] They produced the next collection in 1986 and opened their first store that same year.[7] Michael Gross wrote of their third collection in a 1992 interview, \"They were a secret known only to a handful of Italian fashion editors. Their few models changed behind a rickety screen. They called their collection of T-shirt-cotton and elastic-silk pieces, Transformation.\" The clothing in this collection came with instructions on the seven different ways a piece could be worn in an outfit, as the wearer could use Velcro and snaps to alter the clothing's form.[10] Their fourth collection was the first to make a significant impact on the Italian fashion market. In this collection, Dolce drew upon his Sicilian roots. The collection's advertising campaign was shot by photographer Ferdinando Scianna in Sicily, and featured Dutch model Marpessa Hennink in black and white pictures[11][12] inspired by the Italian cinema of the 1940s. They continued the use of Italian cinema as inspiration in their fifth collection, drawing on the work of filmmaker Luchino Visconti and his film The Leopard.[7] One of the pieces from their fourth collection was labeled \"The Sicilian Dress\" by the fashion press, and was named by author Hal Rubenstein as one of the 100 most important dresses ever designed. It is considered to be the most representative piece of this era for the brand. Rubenstein described the piece in 2012 by writing, \"The Sicilian dress is the essence of Dolce & Gabbana, the brand's sartorial touchstone. The dress takes its cue from a slip\u2014but it's a slip that's adorned Anna Magnani, and it's a silhouette that has graced Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren, [and so forth]. The straps fit tight to the body just as bra straps would; the neckline runs straight across but gets waylaid at least twice, once on each side to caress each breast and in the middle to meet an uplifting tuck that's giving a gentle push up. The slip doesn't just slide down, but comes in at the waist to hold the figure firmly but not too tightly and then widens to emphasise the hips, only to fall with a slight taper at the knees to guarantee that the hips will sway when the wearer walks.\"[13] In 1987, the two launched a separate knitwear line and in 1989, they started designing a lingerie line and a beachwear line. Two years later, they launched their leotard line. In 1989, Dolce & Gabbana opened their first store in Japan in partnership with Kashiyama Co. They started to export their products to the United States, where they founded their own showroom in 1990. In 1992, the same year that they presented their men\u2019s collection, they also launched their first perfume Dolce & Gabbana. They won an \u201cOscar des Parfums\u201d for best male perfume in 1996 from the French Parfum Academy, the first time ever that the title has been awarded to an Italian brand. Towards the end of the 1990s their sales were around $500 million and in 2003 alone, their revenue reached $633.2 million. In 1990, they launched their first men's collection.[14] That year, they also moved the design house into its first official offices and began to design gowns and other more expensive pieces in addition to their original clothing.[10] Their 1990 Spring/Summer women's collection referenced the mythological painting of Raphael, and the duo began to build a reputation for crystal-encrusted clothing. The 1991 Fall/Winter women's collection was also adorned by trinkets, including filigree medals and embellished corsets. The 1992 Fall/Winter women's collection was then inspired by the silver screen of the 1950s, though the collection still included crystal embellished body suits.[15] In 1991, their men's collection was awarded the Woolmark Award for the most innovative men's collection of the year.[16] What is considered to be their first foray into international recognition came when Madonna wore a corset made of gemstones and an accompanying jacket from Dolce & Gabbana at the 1991 New York City premiere of Truth or Dare: In Bed with Madonna. The duo then partnered with Madonna in 1993 to design over 1500 costumes for the artist's Girlie Show international tour in support of her 1992 album Erotica.[14] In an interview about the costumes, Madonna stated that, \"Their clothes are sexy with a sense of humor\u2014like me.\"[10] In 1994, the house's trademark double-breasted jacket was named \"La Turlington\" after model Christy Turlington. That same year the company launched its second main line\u2014D&G, a line aimed at younger individuals. In 1996 the D&G runway show was streamed only on the Internet and not the runway, in an experimental move towards new media. That year Dolce & Gabbana also designed the costumes for the film Romeo + Juliet.[17] In the film industry, both Dolce & Gabbana appeared in the 1995 film The Star Maker (L'Uomo delle Stelle) by director Giuseppe Tornatore, playing minor roles as extras. They appeared in more significant cameo roles in Rob Marshall's film-adaptation of Nine.[18] As stylists, they also worked on the music video Girl Panic! by Duran Duran.[19] In terms of market expansion, in 1989 Dolce & Gabbana signed an agreement with the Kashiyama group to open their first boutique in Japan. They released their first fragrance for women in 1992, called \"Dolce & Gabbana Pour Femme\", which was awarded the Perfume Academy's 1993 award for best feminine fragrance of the year. Their first male fragrance, \"Dolce & Gabbana pour Homme\", was the recipient of the best masculine fragrance of the year award from the same Academy in 1995.[16] That year Dolce & Gabbana's collections caused a controversy with the British and Italian press, when they selected the American gangster motif as inspiration for their work.[20] Dolce & Gabbana transposed this Fall/Winter 1995 inspiration onto women's wear, which critics stated brought an erotic edge to the clothing. The duo had used the motif before in 1992 when photographer Steven Meisel shot an ad campaign for the house in which the models posed in \"gangster chic\". This included wide-lapelled 1930s style coats and black leather caps.[21] Author Nirupama Pundir stated that, \"Dolce & Gabbana, with their superfeminine and fantastical style, broke away from the serious and sober-minded fashions that dominated during much of the Nineties.\"[22] Dolce & Gabbana continued to work with Madonna, designing the costumes for her Drowned World Tour in 2001, in support of her 2000 album Music.[17] They also designed costumes for the international tours of Missy Elliott, Beyonc\u00e9, and Mary J. Blige.[17][23] In 1999, the duo appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in support of singer Whitney Houston, who used the show to debut the Dolce & Gabbana designed costumes for her My Love Is Your Love tour, considered by fashion and music critics to be unusually risqu\u00e9.[24] The duo continued to design costumes for musical artists through the 2000s, including the costumes for Kylie Minogue's Showgirl Homecoming tour.[17] Madonna also participated in Dolce & Gabbana's 2010 advertising campaigns.[13] In the 2000s, Dolce & Gabbana took a great deal of inspiration from the sport of football as well. In 2003 the men's line took its main inspiration from the world's great football stars.[14] Other forms of art began taking inspirations from Dolce & Gabbana too. In 2003 dance music artist Frankie Knuckles said that the fashion house was a \"great barometer\" for trends in both fashion and music.[25] As for their impact on the design world, in 2002 the corsets that were a key part of Dolce & Gabbana's early designs were revived by many of Europe's main designers as a trend.[26] In recent years Dolce & Gabbana has begun holding private viewings of their new collections for buyers, in order to sell their collections before they become public and to pre-empt the copying of their designs by fast fashion companies.[27] By 2005 their turnover was \u20ac597 million.[6] In 2006, the company started a new journey in accessories and leather goods for men and women. The company also ventured into cosmetics, with Scarlett Johansson as the face of the advertising campaign. In 2012, D&G was merged with Dolce & Gabbana in order to strengthen the main line. The final independent D&G collection was the Spring/Summer 2012 collection shown in September 2011.[28] The New Yorker published in 2005 that, \"Dolce and Gabbana are becoming to the two-thousands what Prada was to the nineteen-nineties and Armani was to the nineteen-eighties\u2014gli stilisti whose sensibility defines the decade.\"[9] As for personal awards, in both 1996 and 1997 Dolce & Gabbana were named by FHM as the designers of the year. In 2003 GQ Magazine named Dolce & Gabbana among their \"Men of the Year\". The following year readers of British Elle voted Dolce & Gabbana the best international designers at the 2004 Elle Style Awards.[29] Dolce & Gabbana celebrated the 20th anniversary of their brand on 19 June 2010 at the Piazza della la Scala and Palazzo Marino in Milan. A public exhibition was also held the following day that included a room in which several dozen televisions were piled haphazardly upon each other, each showing a different collection from the design house's twenty-year history.[30] Dolce & Gabbana had two central lines (D&G and Dolce&Gabbana) until 2012, when the lines merged under the label Dolce & Gabbana. Dolce&Gabbana (spelled without spaces, unlike the name of the company) specializes in luxury items inspired by high-designs and is more formal and 'timeless', responding to long-term trends as well as seasonal changes.[31] It also sells sunglasses and corrective eyewear, purses, and watches. In April 2009 it launched its make-up range, unveiled at Selfridges, London by Scarlett Johansson.[32] In February 2010, it was announced that American singer Madonna would design a collection of sunglasses titled MDG, set to be released in May of that year. It also offers fragrances for men and women. An example is 'The One' which is a perfume by Dolce&Gabbana. D & G was the younger, more flamboyant diffusion line of the brand. Unlike Dolce&Gabbana, D&G sold watches as well as clothing: watches were manufactured by Naloni and Binda Group. In 2011, Dolce & Gabbana decided to discontinue the D & G-line in order to put \"more strength and energy\" into their other collections.[33] Dolce & Gabbana created a bridal collection, but only between 1992 and 1998. The Dolce & Gabbana Home Collection\u2014started in 1994\u2014was also discontinued in 1999, with the exception of unique pieces being created for D&G premises. The first women's beachwear collection was developed in 1989, followed by the first men's beachwear collection in 1992. D&G launched an eyewear line in 1998 and a timepieces line in 2000. That same year D&G launched both a men's and women's underwear collection, separate from their Dolce & Gabbana lingerie collection. In 2001 they launched the D&G Junior line for children. In 2006 the duo launched the Anamalier line of leopard print accessories for women, and in 2007 they launched a line of crocodile travel cases for men. Other bags produced by the house include the Miss Sicily tote bag,[34] and the \"Dolce\" bag, offered in straw and leather.[35] In 2009 they launched their first line of color cosmetics,[36] with Scarlett Johansson as the face of the advertising campaign.[37] Dolce & Gabbana launched its first line of fine jewellery in late 2011 with an 80-piece line including bejewelled rosaries, charm bracelets, and necklaces.[38] They later launched a fine jewellery collection for men.[39] Dolce & Gabbana have received several awards for their fragrances, as was described in the above sections. Their current fragrances include: \"The One\", \"Sport\", \"Light Blue\", \"Dolce\", \"Classic\", \"Sicily\", \"The One Rose\", and the original scents \"Pour Homme\" and \"Parfum\".[40] On 16 October 2014, the company announced that Colin Farrell would be the face of their new fragrance called \"Intenso.\"[41] Dolce & Gabbana made the \"DG\" logo an iconic and instantly recognizable symbol,[42] but they were never able to get the matching internet address DG.com. In fact, DG.com is one of the oldest Internet domains and was already registered in 1986 by the computer company Data General, now defunct. After that company closed in 1999, the url went to EMC before Dollar General purchased it in 2010 after a bidding war with Dolce & Gabbana.[43] Dolce & Gabbana has designed the on-field attire for A.C. Milan since 2004.[44] In addition to having their on-field uniforms designed by Dolce & Gabbana, A.C. Milan players also dress in team-issued Dolce & Gabbana attire when at official functions off the field.[45] The duo also designed the off-field suits for the Italy national football team.[46] In 2010, Dolce & Gabbana signed a three-year deal with the Chelsea F.C. to design and provide the club's on- and off-field uniforms and attire. The deal included the creation of clothing for female staff members in addition to male staff members and the players themselves. The off-field outfits designed for the club included a dark blue suit featuring the lion symbol on the breast pocket. The designers also re-designed the club's director's lounge and main office reception area.[47] Dolce & Gabbana were also the named sponsors of the Milano Thunder Italian Boxing Team.[48] In 2006, Dolce & Gabbana partnered with Motorola to produce the Motorola V3i Dolce & Gabbana cellular phone.[49] In 2009, Dolce & Gabbana partnered with Sony Ericsson to produce a version of its Jalou cellular phone line with 24-karat gold details and the logo of the design house emblazoned on the co-designed piece of technology.[50] Dolce & Gabbana also partnered with Citro\u00ebn to co-design a version of their C3 Pluriel vehicle.[51] In 2010 Dolce & Gabbana partnered with Martini to produce a \"gold edition\" of its vermouth.[52] In 2010 the design house then teamed with singer Madonna to release a co-designed line of sunglasses called MDG.[53] The commercial for the first women fragrance of Dolce & Gabbana ran for several years in Italy, created by filmmaker Giuseppe Tornatore, scored by Ennio Morricone, and starred actress Monica Bellucci. The 30-second commercial begins with a man slapping an octopus against the stone ridges of a tide pool. He stands and looks around his surroundings at different women going about their daily lives. One woman (Bellucci) is seen changing into a 1950s-style bathing suit behind a white sheet being held up by two other women. After she changes, she tosses her bra atop a prickly pear cactus and walks towards the ocean. Later she is seen lying atop a well-made bed, and the man who saw her is standing outside her window, holding her bra up to his nose. The film closes with the image of the Dolce & Gabbana fragrance bottles against a black backdrop.[54] In 2003, the Dolce & Gabbana perfume Sicily was advertised in another commercial about a Sicilian funeral, which was also directed by Giuseppe Tornatore.[55] Gisele B\u00fcndchen starred in the 2006 commercial for the fragrance \"The One\", featuring Bundchen in front of a vanity mirror being made up, with flashes of a mob of cameramen interspersed; she then puts on a golden dress, shoes, and a pair of D&G sunglasses.[56] Photographers and filmmakers that have worked with Dolce & Gabbana on advertising campaigns have included Giampaolo Barbieri,[57] Michel Comte,[58] Fabrizio Ferri,[59] Steven Klein,[60][61] Steven Meisel,[62] Mert + Marcus,[63] Jean Baptiste Mondino,[37] Ferdinando Scianna,[64] Giampaolo Sgura,[65] Mario Sorrenti,[66] S\u00f8lve Sundsb\u00f8,[67] Mario Testino,[68] Giuseppe Tornatore, and Mariano Vivanco.[69] Dolce & Gabbana have won two Leadawards for their campaigns from Germany's leading advertising awards. In 2004 they won for their Fall/Winter 2003/04 campaign[70] and in 2006 they won for their Fall/Winter 2005/06 campaign.[71] Originally inspired by eclectic, thrift shop bohemian style, Dolce & Gabbana's deeply colored, animal prints have been described as \"haute hippy dom\" taking inspiration in particular from Italy's prestigious film history. \"When we design it's like a movie (Domenico),\" says Domenico Dolce. \"We think of a story and we design the clothes to go with it (Domenico).\" They claim to be more concerned about creating the best, most flattering clothes than sparking trends, once admitting that they wouldn't mind if their only contribution to fashion history was a black bra (Dolce & Gabbana 2007). Sicily and Sicilian culture is the most important style and identity of Dolce & Gabbana. D & G trademarks include underwear-as-outerwear (such as corsets and bra fastenings), gangster boss pinstripe suits, and extravagantly printed coats. Meanwhile, their feminine collections are always backed by powerful ad campaigns, like the black-and-white ads featuring model Marpessa photographed by Ferdinando Scianna in 1987 (Dolce & Gabbana). \"They find their way out of any black dress, any buttoned-up blouse (Domenico),\" says Rossellini. \"The first piece of theirs I wore was a white shirt, very chaste, but cut to make my breasts look as if they were bursting out of it (Domenico).\" Once dubbed the \"Gilbert and George of Italian fashion\",[72] Dolce & Gabbana gave their fashion interests a musical turn in 1996, by recording their own single, in which they intoned the words \"D&G is love\" over a techno beat (Dolce & Gabbana 2011). Newer to the design game than other heavyweight Italian fashion houses such as Armani and Versace, the pair acknowledge that luck has played its part in their phenomenal success. By 1997, their company reported a turnover of \u20ac400 million, prompting both designers to announce that they planned to retire by the age of 40 \u2013 a promise they did not keep (Domenico). After the designers spotted a Veneziano painting of Christ on the cross wearing a pair of their branded underwear briefs in the Venice Biennale, they commissioned the artist to do a portrait of them with the Madonna portrayed as the likeness of the chanteuse and performer Madonna Ciccone and the courtiers as two putti at her feet.[73][74] In January 2016, the company launched a high-end fashion range aimed at wealthy Muslim women featuring a collection of hijabs and abayas printed with daisies, lemons and roses.[75] In addition to designing clothing, Dolce & Gabbana have co-authored nearly two dozen books featuring photographic narratives as well as collections of their own work. The proceeds of many of these books go to charities including the Children\u2019s Action Network and the Butterfly Onlus \"\u00e9cole sans fronti\u00e8res\" Foundation.[36] The following is a bibliography of their literary works: Dolce & Gabbana opened the La sede di via San Damiano atelier in September 1995. They opened a combined seven-floor boutique and corporate space Lo showroom di via Goldoni in 2002, moving from its prior main showroom at Piazza Umanitaria. In July 2006 Dolce & Gabbana then opened a 5,000 square foot show floor Lo showroom di via Broggi in Milan. The design house also bought the Il Metropol theatre in Milan, a historic cinema built in the 1940s. It was renovated and reopened in September 2005.[36] In 2006 Dolce & Gabbana opened IL GOLD, an establishment with caf\u00e9, bar, bistro, and restaurant areas. This is followed by the opening of a co-sponsored drinking establishment the duo founded at their Milanese men's showroom called the Martini Bar in 2003.[17] An additional Martini Bar was later opened at their Shanghai showroom in 2006.[36] In 2009 Dolce & Gabbana had 93 boutiques and 11 factory outlets, and was sold in over 80 countries.[98] In all they have 251 mono-brand stores.[99] In the United States standalone boutiques can be found in Bal Harbour, Beverly Hills, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, and New York City. Dolce & Gabbana also operates boutiques in other cities in select department stores: Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman. In addition to developing runway shows and advertising campaigns for its collections, Dolce & Gabbana use their spaces to host photography and other art exhibitions. Soon after the opening of the Il Metropol, they hosted two exhibitions by artist Ron Arad in the lobby space: Blo-Glo between April 2006 and April 2007,[100] and Bodyguards in late April 2007.[101] They held photography exhibitions featuring the work of Enzo Sellerio in 2007[102] and Herbert List in 2008.[103] In 2011 Dolce & Gabbana held an open house and architectural exhibition with Studio Piuarch showcasing the studio's various architectural designs and projects since 1996.[104] Studio Piuarch built the Dolce & Gabbana headquarters in 2006, which was where the exhibition and open house was held.[105] Dolce & Gabbana also uses its spaces for book launches and photographic exhibitions of its own clothing, such as the book launch of their book David Gandy in 2011.[106] They also use other spaces as well, such as the Palazzo della Ragione in Milan, where in May 2009 they staged a photographic exhibition of over 100 images selected from the history of US Vogue over its 90-year history. The exhibition was called Extreme Beauty in Vogue.[107][108] The company has production factories in Legnano[109] and Incisa in Val d'Arno.[110] Dolce & Gabbana has been involved in many controversial cases, with accusations mainly related with racism, sexism and homophobia.[111][112] Dolce & Gabbana was publicly criticised by Britain's advertising watchdog Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in January 2007, for an advertising campaign showing models brandishing knives. Following complaints from consumer groups in February 2007, Dolce & Gabbana pulled an advertisement in Spain that showed a man holding a woman to the ground by her wrists while a group of men look on. Spain's Labour and Social Affairs Ministry branded the campaign as illegal and humiliating to women, saying the woman's body position had no relation to the products Dolce & Gabbana was trying to sell.[113] Italian publications followed suit, banning the ad. This advertisement was called \"a glorification of gang rape\" and declared \"one of the most controversial advertisements in fashion history\" by Debonair Magazine.[114] When asked about the ad being banned in Spain, Dolce & Gabbana responded that the \"Spaniards were a bit backward.\"[115] According to the Daily Mail, Dolce & Gabbana's ad was said to \"offend the dignity of the woman.\"[115] This particular ad was brought up again seven years later by Kelly Cutrone, a well-known fashion publicist, when she mentioned it on her Twitter account. According to Nextshark.com, \"she slammed Dolce & Gabbana, claiming the ad, which depicts a woman being pinned to the group by a half-naked man as three men look on, simulates a 'gang bang'.\"[115] According to The Huffington Post UK, feminist writer Louise Pennington recently also commented on the image. She stated that, \"This particular image is a representative of an increasingly misogynistic contraction of women in the fashion industry demonstrating very clear links between the fashion-beauty industry and the mainstreaming of pornography. Those who suggest this image is harmless fail to recognize the reality of rape culture and the dehumanization of women's bodies in our pornographic mainstream media.\"[116] On 5 January 2012, Apple Daily reported that only Hong Kong residents (and not mainland Chinese or foreigners) had been prevented from taking pictures of Dolce & Gabbana window displays in both their Hong Kong stores, stirring anti-Mainland Chinese sentiment.[117] In particular staff and security personnel at their flagship store on Canton Road asserted the pavement area outside was private property where photography was forbidden. The actions sparked protests spanning several days and gained international news coverage on 8 January.[118][119][120][121] Citing the case of Zhou Jiugeng, a Nanjing official whose high-living lifestyle was identified by mainland Chinese internet users using photographs, local news reports speculated that the Dolce & Gabbana photo ban may have been imposed at the request of some wealthy Chinese government officials attempting to block details on the source of their wealth.[122][123] Dolce & Gabbana finally issued a formal apology to the people of Hong Kong from its Milan headquarters on 18 January 2012.[124][125] In an interview in 16 March 2015 issue of Italian magazine Panorama, Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce caused controversy when they remarked, \"We oppose gay adoptions. The only family is the traditional one.\" They also criticized in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and surrogacy by saying, \"No chemical offspring and rented uterus: life has a natural flow, there are things that should not be changed.\"[126] Since the comments were made by two gay men in an industry often seen as gay-friendly, reactions were especially harsh. Critics took to social media to voice their opposition, with the hashtag #BoycottDolceGabbana garnering 30,000 tweets on Twitter in five days. Celebrities, including Elton John, Madonna, Victoria Beckham, Ricky Martin, Martina Navratilova and Courtney Love, were among those expressing anger over the remarks[127]. Love said she would \"burn all of her Dolce and Gabbana clothing\", while John, father of two children conceived through IVF, commented, \"How dare you refer to my beautiful children as 'synthetic'. And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF \u2013 a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children.\"[128] In an Instagram post Madonna, who appeared in a 2010 Dolce & Gabbana campaign, said, \"All babies contain a soul however they come to this earth and their families. There is nothing synthetic about a soul!! So how can we dismiss IVF and surrogacy? Every soul comes to us to teach us a lesson. God has his hand in everything even technology! We are arrogant to think Man does anything on his own. As above so below! Think before you speak.\"[129] More than 10,000 people signed an online petition calling for Macy's and Debenhams to stop stocking the brand in their department stores, until D&G retracted their statements and apologized. Protesters also gathered outside Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s flagship London shop calling for an international boycott of the luxury fashion store.[130] Dolce & Gabbana criticized calls for a boycott on their brand as \"medieval\" and called for fans to use the hashtag #BoycottEltonJohn, though it resulted in only 1,500 tweets.[131] Social conservative website LifeSiteNews launched a petition in support of Dolce & Gabbana that got more than 20,000 signatures.[132] After being asked during an interview with CNN if he supported having children through IVF, Dolce replied, \"Yeah, I don't have anything bad, because the beauty of the world is freedom...We love gay couple. We are gay. We love gay couple. We love gay adoption. We love everything. It's just an express of my private point of view.\"[133][134] In November 2018, Dolce & Gabbana released a series of videos on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter profiles, as well as its Sina Weibo account in China, featuring a Chinese model with her eye intentionally narrowed [135], dressed up in the brand's garments and accessories and clumsily attempting to use chopsticks to eat Italian food in a pretentious way. The video narratage is in Standard Mandarin with a hubristic and lecturing tone, while having sexually suggestive lines.[136][137] These videos were intended to promote \"The Great Show\", a catwalk event to be held at Expo Center of Shanghai, China on 21 November. Social media users commented that it reflects Dolce & Gabbana's lack of understanding of Chinese culture and racism. Under the public pressure, D&G removed this series from its Sina Weibo whilst still keeping them on Instagram.[138] Social media outcry was further exacerbated by a screen capture of racist comments alleged to have been made by D&G co-founder, Stefano Gabbana, in a direct message on Instagram to an American fashion blog[139]. Stefano Gabbana complained about removing the videos from the internet and called China the \"Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia\", adding that it was a \"country of shit\" in the message.[140][141][142] Later Dolce & Gabbana claimed on Instagram that both the brand's and the designer's accounts had been hacked. Wang Junkai and Dilraba Dilmurat, both of whom served as the brand's celebrity ambassadors, severed their ties with the company. Other celebrities, including Zhang Ziyi, Li Bingbing and Chen Kun withdrew from the event. Ultimately, the show was cancelled by the brand.[143][144][145][146] Chinese e-commerce sites, including Alibaba and JD.com, removed the products of Dolce & Gabbana.[147] The founders of Dolce & Gabbana apologized in a video on 23 November, which was posted on its Sina Weibo account, and also posted on Instagram and Facebook later. Throughout the video, the founders can be seen reading off a script from a teleprompter located on the right. At the end of the video, the founders were saying \"\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\" (sorry) in Chinese. Meanwhile, the three videos were finally removed from the official Instagram account.[147][148][149] In their Spring/Summer 2013 collection they included earrings and fabric prints that to American audiences closely resembled imagery associated with the Mammy archetype with many media outlets commenting the likeness. The designs, however, were intended to make reference to Sicilian Moor's heads, popular good luck charms in Sicilian folklore.[150] In the spring of 2016, the brand came under fire for a listing on their web store of a pair of sandals featuring colorful decorations and pom poms with the title of \"Slave Sandal in Napa Leather\". Other retailers listed them as the Bianca or the Pom Pom sandal. Sandals in Italy are often referred to as such in reference to Ancient Rome. When social media users called the name into question, the listing was changed.[151] In May 2009, the Italian government charged Dolce & Gabbana with tax evasion for having moved assets of about 249 million euros to Luxembourg in the 2004\u20132006 period.[152][153] On 19 June 2013, they were found guilty of failing to declare 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of income to authorities after moving their brand to Gado, a Luxembourg-based holding company. The court sentenced them both to one year and eight months in jail.[154] Dolce & Gabbana were quick to file a 90-page appeal and thus did not face any jail time. On 30 April 2014, a three judge panel overruled the appeal and decided to uphold the initial sentence.[155] However, since they were sentenced to only one year and six months, which is under the two-year minimum, both of them will not serve actual imprisonment in jail.[155][156] On 24 October 2014, both Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were found innocent of tax evasion by the Italian Court of Justice.[157] After the court's decision was announced, Stefano Gabbana tweeted in Italian, \"We knew it!!! We are honest people!\"[158][159] ",

The company produces cars adding design and Italian standards to components supplied by foreign companies such as Chery Automobile. The company, based in Macchia d'Isernia, Molise, soon became famous for its unusual initial marketing strategy; initially, without its own distribution network, the company has entered into partnership with Finiper Group. Until 2009 you could find and buy cars at hypermarkets. Today the company has its own supply chain with more than seventy dealers and more than a hundred Service DR on all the Italian territory. DR was founded by Massimo Di Risio in 2006 with the intent to sell vehicles that boast an Italian design, counting on the support of other production companies for the supply of components. The idea for DR was born within the past experience of the founder Massimo Di Risio, who in 1985 founded the Di Risio s.r.l. for the distribution and commercialization of cars of various makes, including the Saleen S7. Later Di Risio founded Katay, a brand dedicated entirely to imports of Chinese Gonow vehicles. Today the company has a manufacturing plant, with a production rate of about 100 vehicles per day, at Macchia d'Isernia and bases in Rome, Campobasso and Pescara. Since 2009, seventy dealers were opened throughout Italy and a network of after-sales service centers with more than one hundred DR Service headed by Enrico Romano (Italy Jaguar's administrator and ex Ferrari manager). Since 2010 the administration of DR is led by Roberto Risi, ex manager of Finance Manufacturing Worldwide of Fiat. The first car sold from the house is a SUV, called DR5, with Chery components and Bosch electronic. This model was presented as a prototype at the 31\u00ba Bologna Motor Show in 2006. Dr5 was the first DR model, launched in November 2007, and for the occasion Massimo Di Risio celebrated the moment with the symbolic gesture of punching the chassis number on the first car produced. The 33 \u00b0 Motor Show hosted the presentation of two other models: The compact SUV DR3 and the small city car DR1. The components of DR1 are derived from Riich M1 of Chery group. In Geneva the DR2 was presented, a 5-door subcompact which has been introduced on the market in spring 2010. In December 2010 was presented the DR3 in Bologna based on the Jonway UFO 3-door but never came in to production.[1] DR Zero DR1 DR2 DR3 DR4 DR5 DR6 DR City Cross Thanks to the business strategy the automotive brand has become famous in Italy. Not having a distribution network outside the production site, DR has entered into an agreement with the Group Finiper to implement a distribution strategy and contacts with the public within supermarkets and shopping centers. In December 2009, in conjunction with the launch of the DR1, DR Motor Company has inaugurated its Italian sales network and terminated the contract with the Group Finiper. To date, the network dedicated to the distribution of passenger cars in DR has more than one hundred seventy dealers and workshops. ",

            "text": "Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. is the motorcycle-manufacturing division of Italian company Ducati, headquartered in Bologna, Italy. The company is owned by German automotive manufacturer Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini, which is in turn owned by the Volkswagen Group.[2] In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons, Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati founded Societ\u00e0 Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes, condensers and other radio components. In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.  Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing. Meanwhile, at the small Turinese firm SIATA (Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small pushrod engine for mounting on bicycles. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the \"Cucciolo\" (Italian for \"puppy,\" in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale. In 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle. This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48\u00a0cc bike weighing 98 pounds (44\u00a0kg), with a top speed of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), and had a 15\u00a0mm carburetor  (0.59-inch) giving just under 200\u00a0mpg\u2011US (1.2\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 240\u00a0mpg\u2011imp). Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of \"55M\" and \"65TL\". When the market moved toward larger motorcycles, Ducati management decided to respond, making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show, introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser (a four-stroke motor scooter). Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production. In 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250\u00a0cc road bike then available, the Mach 1.[3][4][5] In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement V-twin  motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked desmodromic valve design. In 1985, Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the \"Cagiva\" name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the \"Ducati\" name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company \"Ducati Motor Holding SpA\". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi. In April 2012, Volkswagen Group's Audi subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for \u20ac860\u00a0million (US$1.2\u00a0billion). Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984. Analysts doubted a tiny motorcycle maker would have a meaningful effect on a company the size of Volkswagen, commenting that the acquisition has \"a trophy feel to it,\" and, \"is driven by VW's passion for nameplates rather than industrial or financial logic\". Italian luxury car brand Lamborghini was strengthened under VW ownership.[6][7] AUDI AG's Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. subsidiary acquired 100 percent of the shares of Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. on 19 July 2012 for \u20ac747\u00a0million (US$909\u00a0million).[2] Since 1926, Ducati has been owned by a number of groups and companies.  From the 1960s to the 1990s, the Spanish company MotoTrans licensed Ducati engines and produced motorcycles that, although they incorporated subtle differences, were clearly Ducati-derived. MotoTrans's most notable machine was the 250\u00a0cc 24 Horas (Spanish for \"24 hours\"). Ducati is best known for high-performance motorcycles characterized by large-capacity four-stroke, 90\u00b0 V-twin engines,[12] with a desmodromic valve design.[13] Ducati refers to this configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal, making it look like a letter \"L\". Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve springs used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a \"passive\" closing mechanism under the same conditions. While most other manufacturers use wet clutches (with the spinning parts bathed in oil)[14] Ducati previously used multiplate dry clutches in many of their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement may not be as smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly.  Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines. Ducati also extensively uses a trellis frame, although Ducati's MotoGP project broke with this tradition by introducing a revolutionary carbon fibre frame for the Ducati Desmosedici GP9. The chief designer of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was Fabio Taglioni (1920\u20132001). His designs ranged from the small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the Pantah in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the Ducati SuperSport (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt to actuate the engine's valves. Taglioni used the Cavallino Rampante (identified with the Ferrari brand) on his Ducati motorbikes, Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring as a sign of respect and admiration for Francesco Baracca, a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.[15] In 1973, Ducati commemorated its 1972 win at the Imola 200 with the production model green frame Ducati 750 SuperSport. Ducati also targeted the offroad market with the two-stroke Regolarit\u00e0 125, building 3,486 models from 1975 to 1979, but the bike was not successful.[16] In 1975, the company introduced the 860 GT, designed by noted car stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro. Its angular lines were unique, but raised handlebars made for an uncomfortable seating position at high speeds and also caused steering issues.[17] Ducati's liquid-cooled, multi-valve V-twins, made from 1985 on, are known as Desmoquattro (\"desmodromic valve four\"). These include the 851, 916 and 996, 999 and a few predecessors and derivatives. The Ducati Paso was introduced in 1986 with the Paso 750, followed in 1989 with the Paso 906. The final version came in 1991 with the 907IE (Iniezione Elettronica), now without the name \"Paso\". The design was from the hand of Massimo Tamburini, who also designed the Ducati 916 and MV Agusta F4. The Paso was a typical \"you love it, you hate it\" bike. However, at that time it looked like that all-enclosed bodywork would be the future for all motorcycles. The Paso design was copied for the Moto Morini Dart 400 and Cagiva Freccia 125. Together with Tamburini's Bimota DB1, they were enormously influential in terms of styling. In 1993, Miguel Angel Galluzzi introduced the Ducati Monster,[18] a naked bike with exposed trellis and engine. Today the Monster accounts for almost half of the company's worldwide sales. The Monster has undergone the most changes of any motorcycle that Ducati has ever produced. In 1993, Pierre Terblanche, Massimo Bordi and Claudio Domenicali designed the Ducati Supermono. A 550\u00a0cc single-cylinder lightweight \"Catalog Racer\". Only 67 were built between 1993 and 1997. In 1994, the company introduced the Ducati 916 model designed by Massimo Tamburini,[19] a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a single-sided swingarm. Ducati has since ceased production of the 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the 748, 996 and 998) with the 749 and 999. In 2006, the retro-styled Ducati PaulSmart 1000 LE was released, which shared styling cues with the 1973 750 SuperSport (itself a production replica of Paul Smart's 1972 race winning 750 Imola Desmo), as one of a SportClassic series representing the 750 GT, 750 Sport, and 750 SuperSport Ducati motorcycles. Ducati has produced several styles of motorcycle engines, including varying the number of cylinders, type of valve actuation and fuel delivery. Ducati is best known for its V-twin engine, called an L-twin by the company, which is the powerplant in the majority of Ducati-marqued motorcycles. Ducati has also manufactured engines with one, two, three or four cylinders; operated by pull rod valves and push rod valves; single, double and triple overhead camshafts; two-stroke and even at one stage manufactured small diesel engines, many of which were used to power boats, generators, garden machinery and emergency pumps (for example, for fire fighting). The engines were the IS series from 7 to 22\u00a0hp (5.2 to 16.4\u00a0kW) air-cooled and the larger twin DM series water- and air-cooled. The engines have been found in all parts of the globe. Wisconsin Diesel even assembled and \"badge engineered\" the engines in the USA. They have also produced outboard motors for marine use. Currently, Ducati makes no other engines except for its motorcycles. On current Ducati motors, except for the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are actuated by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a timing belt driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the camshaft drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older single-cylinder motorcycles \u2014 the shaft tube is visible on the outside of the cylinder. Ducati is also famous for using the desmodromic valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve springs to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from valve float at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads. In the 1960s and 1970s, Ducati produced a wide range of small two-stroke bikes, mainly sub-100\u00a0cc capacities. Large quantities of some models were exported to the United States. Ducati has produced the following motorcycle engine types: A key part of Ducati's marketing strategy since the 1990s has been fostering a distinct community identity in connection with branding efforts including online communities and local, regional and national Ducati enthusiast clubs. There are more than 400 Ducati clubs worldwide and 20,000 registered users of the Ducati Owners Club web site and 17,000 subscribers to the racing web site.[28] Enthusiasts and riders are informally referred to in the motorcycling community as Ducatista (singular) or Ducatisti (plural). In North America there are several Ducati enthusiasts organizations with varying degrees of factory sponsorship, such as the Bay Area Desmo Owners Club (BADOC) located in and around the city of San Francisco, CA. Ducati Riders of Illinois (DRILL) located in Chicago, IL. DESMO, the Ducati Enthusiast Sport Motorcycle Organization, is a North American group affiliated with the factory Desmo Owners Club.[29] Some groups are focused on vintage Ducatis[30] while several are based primarily or entirely on email discussion lists or web forums.[31] Ducati has a wide range of accessories, lifestyle products and co-branded merchandise bearing their logos and designs. The company has a licensing agreement with Tumi Inc., launching a collection of eight co-branded luggage pieces in 2006, sold through both of the brands' retail outlets.[32] Ducati's history with motorsport began with speed records on Cucciolo motorized bicycle factory racers in 1951, followed in 1954 with bringing in Fabio Taglioni to found a road-racing program with the 100 Gran Sport.[33] As of 2009[update], Ducati was still pursuing the \"win on Sunday, sell on Monday\" business model and spending 10% of company revenues, \u20ac40\u00a0million, on its racing business.[34][35] Ducati rejoined Grand Prix motorcycle racing in 2003, after a 30-year absence.[36] On 23 September 2007, Casey Stoner clinched his and Ducati's first Grand Prix World Championship. When Ducati re-joined MotoGP in 2003, MotoGP had changed its rules to allow four-stroke 990\u00a0cc engines to race. At the time Ducati was the fastest bike. In 2007, MotoGP reduced the engine size to 800\u00a0cc (49\u00a0cu\u00a0in), and Ducati continued to be the fastest with a bike that was markedly quicker than its rivals as was displayed by Casey Stoner on tracks with long straights. For 2009, Ducati Marlboro Team campaigned their Desmosedici GP9 with former World Champions Casey Stoner and Nicky Hayden.[37] Ducati also supplied customer bikes to Pramac Racing, with Mika Kallio and Niccol\u00f2 Canepa riding for the team in 2009.[38] Nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi rode for Ducati Corse for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.[39][40] Rossi returned to the Yamaha team for the 2013 season.[41] For 2013, Ducati Marlboro Team raced with Nicky Hayden and the Italian rider Andrea Dovizioso. In 2014 Cal Crutchlow teamed up with Dovizioso for the season, and he left at the end of the year. In 2015, Ducati Marlboro Team, under the control of the new race team director Gigi Dall'Igna and the new Desmosedici GP15, raced with two Italian riders: Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone. Dovizioso and Iannone returned for another season in 2016 with Michele Pirro as official tester. As well as this, Casey Stoner also tested Ducati machinery during the season. [42] In 2017-8, Ducati Marlboro Team rider Andrea Dovizioso raced with his new teammate Jorge Lorenzo, who joined the Ducati team from Yamaha Factory Racing with a two seasons contract.  In 2019, Danilo Petrucci has joined Dovizioso on the factory team.[43] The company has won 14 riders world championships and 17 manufacturers world championships, competing since the series' inception in 1988. At the end of 2015, Ducati has amassed 318 wins, more than any other manufacturer involved in the championship. Ducati has also won the manufacturers' championship for years 2008\u20132009, 2011 and 2016. Ducati has won the British Superbike Championship ten times. In the AMA Superbike Championship, Ducati has had its share of success, with Doug Polen winning the title in 1993 and Troy Corser the following year in 1994. Ducati has entered a bike in every AMA Superbike season since 1986, but withdrew from the series after the 2006 season.[44][45][46] Ducati had an important place in early Superbike racing history in the United States and vice versa: In 1977, Cycle magazine editors Cook Neilson and Phil Schilling took a Ducati 750SS to first place at Daytona in the second-ever season of AMA Superbike racing. \"Neilson retired from racing at the end of the year, but the bike he and Schilling built \u2014 nicknamed Old Blue for its blue livery \u2014 became a legend,\" says Richard Backus from Motorcycle Classics: \"How big a legend? Big enough for Ducati to team with Italian specialty builder NCR to craft a limited-edition update, New Blue, based on the 2007 Sport 1000S, and big enough to inspire the crew at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum (see Barber Motorsports Park), arguably one of the most important motorcycle museums in the world, to commission Ducati specialist Rich Lambrechts to craft a bolt-by-bolt replica for its collection. The finished bike's name? Deja Blue.\"[47] Ducati's first ever world title was the 1978 TT Formula 1 World Championship, achieved thanks to Mike Hailwood's victory at the Isle of Man TT. Between 1981 and 1984 Tony Rutter won four TT Formula 2 World Championships riding Ducati bikes.  ",

Established in 1936 by two brothers, Julius and Gilbert Durst, who were enthusiasts in the field of photography, encouraged by their mother, who was also a keen photographer and had her own darkroom. Durst ended production of their enlargers in late 2006 due to a drop in sales, probably due to growth of minilabs and later digital imaging. In the 70 years of manufacturing enlargers their sales peaked in 1979 with 107,000 sold. Durst have filed over 500 patents for various components and designs of enlargers. Now, Durst produce a range of photochemical (Durst Lambda and Theta printers) and super wide format inkjet printers based on UV polymerization ink technology. The quality of the output of these products is exceptional, as was the case with the company's historical enlargers, for high quality image reproduction and high versatility of application, from paper and plastic materials to ceramics and wood. The Durst Lambda and Theta models are widely used in the photographic printing industry to produce digital C-Type prints on light sensitive colour and monochrome papers and transparency display materials such as Kodak Duratrans and Duraclear. Images are produced by exposing light sensitive material with RGB laser light which is then developed through the relevant chemical process. The Lambda is a standalone machine the requires a separate chemical processor and takes a roll of paper 50 inches (130\u00a0cm) wide, whereas the Theta uses a roll measuring 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) and has its chemical processor built in. The Theta is also capable of holding two different paper types at once. The Durst Lambda is a continuous roll-to-roll single beam, three-laser (RGB) exposure system giving total size flexibility and achieves an image quality which is superior to all large format printers - photographic, inkjet and electrostatic). The Durst Lambda exposes digital information (raster pixel) directly to conventional photographic media at full continuous tone with a linear writing speed of up to 65 cm (26 in.) per minute with the choice of two resolutions of 200 and 400 ppi (equal to an apparent resolution of 4000 dpi). The Lambda produces images with the highest possible resolution (68 billion colours) and with a radiometric repeatability of 0.025 D per colour. Prints can be produced to an infinite length and when the 50 inch paper width is exceeded, images are automatically divided-up and exposed in strips.Durst expanded in 2003 into UV Curable Digital Inkjet Printers with the Rho 160, and now produces a full line of Large Format, Textile, Ceramic, Label and Industrial Inkjet printers for a variety of applications.[1] The Durst Rho 500 Roll-to-Roll Printer and the Durst Rho P10-250 Flatbed Printer have both won \"Product of the Year\" at the Specialty Graphics Industry Association Awards.[2]  ",

            "text": "Edison S.p.A is an energy company in the field of electricity and natural gas headquartered in Milan, Italy. The company was established in 1884. Edison employs about 4,000\u00a0people in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Chairman of the board is Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy (CEO of EDF) and chief executive officer is Bruno Lescoeur. Edison was established in 1884  in Milan as a power utility.  It built Europe's first power plant at Santa Radegonda, in Milan. In the 1950s, Edison invested to diversify its activities, growing primarily in the chemical sector. By 1960, Edison was Italy's second largest chemical company.[2]  Following the nationalization and resulting sale of its electric assets to Enel in 1962, Edison downsized its energy business, producing power only for self-consumption and operating only the power plants that supplied the Group's industrial facilities.[2] In 1966, Edison merged with Montecatini, to create Montedison, Italy's largest industrial chemistry group.[citation needed] In 1979, Montedison's electric power assets (21 hydroelectric and 2 thermoelectric power plants) were conveyed to Selm, a new company that four years later was listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. In 1991, Selm changed its name back to the historical Edison name.[2] The years that followed marked a period of major growth, owing in part to the 1991 National Energy Plan that promoted the construction of generating facilities based on renewable energy, or their equivalent, providing fresh momentum for the development of facilities for self-consumption. Also in the 1990s, Edison strengthened its hydrocarbon sector activities by acquiring reserves.[2] Starting in 1999, the new laws that gradually deregulated the energy market reintroduced competition in the electric power and the natural gas industries. Edison began to supply electric power to eligible customers and expand its downstream presence in the natural gas area.[2] In July 2001, a public tender offer to acquire Montedison (which was controlled by Edison) was received from Italenergia S.p.A., owned by a group consisting of Fiat (38.6%), Electricit\u00e9 de France (18%), Carlo Tassara (20%): Capitalia (9.6%), IMI Investimenti of the Sanpaolo IMI Group (7.8%), and Banca Intesa (6%). In June 2002, this group entered into an agreement for the reorganization of Edison. The plan, completed in December 2002, provided for creation of Italenergia Bis, a new holding company where all shareholders of Italenergia transferred their interests. The following year, Edison, Sondel and Fiat Energia merged into Montedison to create a new company called Edison.[3] On September 16, 2005, Transalpina di Energia purchased 63.3% of the common shares of Edison from Italenergia Bis.  The entire share capital of Transalpina di Energia is owned in equal shares by WGRM, a subsidiary of Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF), and Delmi, a subsidiary of A2A S.p.A.[4] In 2012, EDF made a successful offer for the 99,483% of Edison's voting capital.[5] Edison's primary activities are production and distribution of electricity and natural gas. Edison and its subsidiaries operate across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.[6][7][8] Edison is the second largest power producer in Italy (about 15% of national output) and in Greece (about 12% of national output).[6]  It operates in Greece through subsidiary Elpedison (38% interest, a joint venture between Edison, Hellenic Petroleum and Ellaktor.[9]  Together with DEPA, it develops the Greece\u2013Italy pipeline project.[10] Hydrocarbons operations include exploration, production and distribution of natural gas and crude oil. As of 2010, Edison owned 80\u00a0hydrocarbons concessions and permits with hydrocarbons reserves of 52.8\u00a0billion cubic metres (1.86\u00a0trillion cubic feet).[11] [12][13][14][15] The Company\u2019s controlling shareholder is Electricit\u00e9 de France with 99.4% of the capital. [16][8] On July 19, 2016 the company launched a whistleblowing platform available to its employees in order to collect information about wrongdoing and fight internal corruption.[17][18] ",

Following a period of profound transformation (sale of the ISAB refinery and of the ISAB Energy power station, the creation of the TotalErg joint venture and the sale of the ERG Oil Sicilia network), ERG Group is now the leading operator in wind energy in Italy and is currently among the top ten in Europe (onshore). It also owns a combined cycle power plant (ERG Power, 480 MW) in Priolo Gargallo in Sicily and recently purchased the Terni (527 MW) hydroelectric unit from EON Produzione. As regards the geographic distribution of wind farms, the MW installed are mainly in Italy (1,093), where other ERG's Operations & Maintenance logistics centres are also located. ERG is present with 252 MW in France, 216 MW in Germany, in Romania (70 MW) and in Bulgaria (54 MW).[3] Over the course of 2015, wind farms in Poland became operational (approximately 80 MW). ERG was founded by Edoardo Guida Garrone in 1938,[4] founding a company for the refining of petroleum. In 1952 signs an agreement to refine the oil on behalf of BP.[5] During the 1960s and 1970s has started to build some oil refineries and pipelines in Italy, in particular a pipeline in Arquata Scrivia[6] and an oil refinery in Priolo Gargallo (ISAB).[4] In the 1980s has acquired the petrol stations networks owned by Elf, Chevron and BP in Italy, through ERG Petroli.[4] Since 1997 the company is listed on the Italian Stock Exchange.[7] In 1999 it opened gas, (petrol), stations network in Spain through ERG Petroleos,[6] sold in 2008 to Saras S.p.A.[8] In 2008 it signed an agreement with Lukoil, sharing the 49% of oil refinery in Priolo Gargallo.[9][10] In 2009 it launched its own Mobile virtual network operator: ERG Mobile, becoming the first Italian oil company with its own telecommunications company.[11] In 2010 ERG Petroli and TotalErg Italia merge in TotalErg, starting operation on October 1, 2010. In early 2011 ERG reduced its share in ISAB from 51% to 40%.[12] Two years later ERG completed the exit from the refining sector.[13][14] In the meantime (since 2010) ERG grew in the Italian wind power sector becoming in 2013 the leading wind operator in Italy.[15][16] Since 2007 ERG started to operate also abroad, in the French[17] and German[18]wind markets, acquiring wind farms also in Bulgaria, Romania, Polonia and United Kingdom.[15] In 2015 ERG entered the hydroelectric sector, via acquisition of E.On\u2019s Italian assets, with 527 MW of capacity.[19][20] The power plants are located in the Italian regions of Umbria, Marche and Lazio. In January 2018, ERG completed the closing with the api Group regarding the sale of its 51% shareholding in TotalErg S.p.A, completing its industrial transformation process towards renewables.[15] In the same year, ERG entered the solar power business[21] through the acquisition of 89 MW (30 photovoltaic plants) in Italy. ERG was the main sponsor of U.C. Sampdoria (until 2011),[22] a football club that was owned by the Garrone family (Riccardo Garrone was the chairman, with Edoardo as the vice-chairman, and Vittorio as director), for more than 9 years.

In 1979, Ellesse's Jet Pant, a ski pant featuring padded knees and a wide lower leg to fit around a ski boot, was included in an event at the Pompidou Centre in Paris celebrating Italian design.[2] Another sport with which Ellesse has been closely associated since its early years is tennis. The Ellesse logo references the form of a tennisball with the shape of the tips of a pair of skis. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Ellesse gained a reputation for combining sportswear functionality with street-level fashion styling. It was one of the first sportswear brands to feature their logo prominently on the outside of their garments. During the mid-1980s, French designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac worked with Ellesse, an early collaboration between a sportswear company and a fashion designer. The UK casuals adopted the brand in the '80s as premium sportswear took off across British lad culture. A number of sports celebrities have endorsed Ellesse, including tennis players Tommy Haas, Chris Evert, Guillermo Vilas, Boris Becker, Mats Wilander, Pat Cash, Arantxa S\u00e1nchez and Anna Kournikova, skiers Marc Girardelli and Jean-Luc Cr\u00e9tier, and Formula 1 driver Alain Prost. Other celebrities associated with the brand include boxer Muhammad Ali, Liam Smith Natas Kaupas and Maurice Cheeks, and actors Brigitte Nielsen and Roger Moore. Ellesse also ventured into football sponsorship, and manufactured the kits for the New York Cosmos in the '80s. In 1994 British brand management company Pentland Group purchased 90% of the shares of Ellesse for \u00a320 million. Pentland had been Ellesse's UK distributor since 1981. Servadio retained 10% of the shares.[3] Pentland Group also owns other well-known sportswear brands such as Berghaus and Speedo.[4] It currently licenses the Ellesse brand to partners in countries around the world, who manufacture and distribute Ellesse products in their territory.

It has a stock market capitalisation of \u20ac39.4 billion, making it Europe's largest integrated utility by capitalisation.[citation needed] The company is quoted on the FTSE MIB index on the Milan Stock Exchange.[1] In 1898, the production of electricity in Italy was 100\u00a0GWh,[5] and had a value of over $56\u00a0billion by 1960.[clarification needed][6][7] The majority of the electricity was produced by regional private companies,[8] or by companies linked to other industrial bodies,[9][10][11] that were both local and regional, by exploiting the specific characteristics of the territory: its hydrogeological resources.[12] The state subsidised the construction of power stations and other necessary construction work in a territory in order to increase the production of electricity.[13][14][15]  In 1961, the state regulated distribution with unified national tariffs set on the basis of equal consumption classes (through the Equalisation Fund for the Electricity Sector[10]:137[16]), and by requiring power companies to provide access to electricity for everyone.[9][11][17][18] In 1962, the government institutionalised the Entity for electricity with the aim of making electricity a means for the development of the country and in order to define a national policy for electricity based on the experiences of other countries such as France and the United Kingdom.[17][18] At the beginning of 1962, the Fanfani IV Cabinet made committed the government to put together a proposal for the unification of the national electricity system within three months of the parliament passing a confidence motion.[19][20] During the Chamber of Deputies assembly of 26 June 1962, the government presented a bill that sanctioned the principles and procedures for the establishment of the Ente Nazionale per l'energia Elettrica (National Entity for Electricity, E.N.EL., or Enel).[8] According to the bill, Enel was going to acquire all assets of companies producing, processing, transmitting, and distributing electricity, with the exception of self-producers\u2014companies that produced more than 70% of their electricity for other production processes\u2014(the same exception was later applied to municipal authorities), and of small businesses that did not produce more than 10\u00a0million kilowatt hours per year.[21][22] Procedures to assess the value of the acquired companies were defined, and it was established that compensation was to be paid to creditors in 10 years at an interest rate of 5.5%.[21][23] Within this framework, 1962 was to be considered a transition year, in which all income and expenses of the acquired companies would be transferred to Enel. 1963 was thus the first operational year of the newly formed company.[24] The first companies to be acquired were:[25] SIP (Piedmont),[26] Edison Volta (Lombardy),[27] SADE (Veneto),[28][29] SELT-Valdarno (Tuscany), SRE (Lazio), SME (Campania), SGES (Sicily), and Carbosarda (Sardinia). Enel's early goals were the modernization and development of the electricity grid with the construction of a high voltage power lines backbone, international connections, connections to the islands, rural electrification, and the creation of a national centre for dispatching. These projects were to be co-financed by the state through the issuing, in 1965, of bonds valued over 200\u00a0billion Italian liras.[30][31] In 1967, Enel, which was originally supervised by the Committee of Ministers, began to be overseen by the inter-ministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE), under the Ministry of Industry.[21][32][33] During this period, production from thermal power stations surpassed, for the very first time, that of hydroelectric power.[34][35] In 1963, the National Dispatch Centre of Rome was created, to manage the energy network by coordinating the production plants, the transmission network, the distribution, as well as the interconnection of the Italian electricity system with that of foreign countries, by adjusting in real time the production and transmission of energy on the basis of actual demand.[3][25][31] In terms of rural electrification, the settlements that were not connected to the electricity grid declined from 1.27% in 1960 to 0.46% in 1964, with over 320,000 new residents being connected.[36]  In the five-year period between 1966 and 1970, further investments for rural electrification were made, where 80% of the costs were covered by the state and 20% by Enel, part of those costs being incurred by reducing some rates as an incentive for agricultural development.[37] In 1968, the construction of the 380 kV high-voltage connection between Florence and Rome began, with the aim of joining the high voltage electrical system of the north with that of the centre and the south.[38][39] Around the same time, international high voltage connections with France (380 kV Venaus-Villarodin, 1969) and Switzerland were also put in place.[40][41] In the same year, undersea electrical cables were put in place to connect the peninsula and the islands of Elba (1966),[42] Ischia (1967),[42][43] and Sardinia through Corsica (1967).[35] In 1963, Enel was involved in the Vajont Dam disaster. On 9 October 1963, a huge landslide of 260\u00a0million cubic metres fell into the reservoir formed by the dam. The dam and power plant had been built by the Societ\u00e0 Adriatica di Elettricit\u00e0 (the Adriatic Electricity Company, or SADE) and then sold to Edison, and it had just been transferred as part of the nationalisation process to the newly established Enel. The landslide created huge waves in the Vajont reservoir, which partially flooded the villages of Erto e Casso and swept over the dam, completely wiping out the towns in the valley below it: Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova and Fa\u00e8. Approximately two thousand people died in the disaster. Enel and Montedison were charged in the ensuing trial as the companies responsible for the disaster, a responsibility considered all more serious because of the predictability of the event. The two companies were forced to pay damages to the communities involved in the catastrophe. The decade of the 1970s was distinguished by a major energy crisis that led the company to implement drastic austerity measures, and the establishment of a national energy plan that defined the objectives of both building new power plants and searching for new energy sources. In 1975, as a result of the 1973 oil crisis and the austerity measures, and following the establishment of the first National Energy Plan (PEN), the aim of the company became that of reducing Enel's dependence on hydrocarbons, which was to be achieved with the use of other energy sources, including hydro, geothermal, coal, reducing waste, and, in particular, the use of nuclear power.[21][46][47] Several new plants were built in the course of the decade.[48] In the early 1970s, the construction of the nuclear power station Caorso (Emilia-Romagna), the first major nuclear power plant in Italy (to generate 840-860\u00a0MW), began. The station became operational in 1978.[49] Between 1972 and 1978, the hydroelectric plant of Taloro was built in the province of Nuoro (Sardinia).[50] In 1973, the hydroelectric plant of San Fiorano became operational. In 1977, a thermoelectric power plant opened in Torre del Sale, near Piombino (Tuscany).[51] At the end of the 1970s, the construction of the thermal power plant of Porto Tolle (Veneto) began, whose first completed section became active in 1980.[52][53] Between 1971 and 1977, the pilot 1000 kV transmission facilities in Suvereto (Tuscany) were tested.[54][55] In 1974, the construction of the Adriatic high voltage electric backbone was completed.[56][57] Between 1973 and 1977, wells for the production of geothermal energy were drilled in Torre Alfina, in the province of Viterbo (Lazio).[58] The dam of Alto Gesso (Piedmont) was completed in 1982 as part of the hydroelectric power station Luigi Einaudi \"Entracque\".[59][60] The 1980s were characterised by the construction of new plants and the testing of alternative forms of energy, the Italian nuclear power phase-out, as well as a gradual reduction of reliance on oil, which decreased from 75.3% in 1973 to 58.5% in 1985.[61][62][63] Several large power plants became active during this period. Among these, the fossil fuel power plant of Fiumesanto (Sardinia) in 1983\u201384;[19] the pumped-storage hydroelectricity power station of Edolo (Lombardy) in 1984\u201385, one of the biggest of its kind in Europe;[64] and the coal power plant of Torrevaldiagia Nord (Lazio) in 1984.[19] In 1981, with the help of the European Economic Community, Enel built the first large scale compact linear Fresnel reflector concentrated solar power plant, the 1 MWe Eurelios power station in Adrano (Sicily).[65] The plant was shut down in 1987. In 1984, the photovoltaic power station of Vulcano (Sicily) became active.[66] In the same year, the first wind farm of the country became operational in Alta Nurra (Sardinia).[67] During 1985, the national center for the dispatch and control of the electricity network was gradually transferred from the center of Rome to Settebagni, and made a part of a bigger European network for the synchronisation of electricity production.[68][69] In 1986, Enel had its first positive balance, with a profit of 14.1 billion Italian liras.[70] In 1987, in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, the first referendum on nuclear power took place and was won by those opposed to nuclear power. This result marked the end of nuclear power in Italy, the closing and suspension of all construction of nuclear power stations, and the establishment of a new national energy plan.[49][71] The Caorso Nuclear Power Plant in Emilia-Romagna, which had been inactive since 1986 due to refuelling, was never reactivated and was finally closed in 1990. The Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant in Piedmont was deactivated in 1987 and shut down in 1990. The construction work on the Montalto di Castro Nuclear Power Station, started in 1982, was interrupted in 1988. The station was converted the following year into a multi-fuel plant. The Latina Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in 1988. The Garigliano Nuclear Power Plant had been shut down since 1978. In 1988, the new National Energy Plan (PEN) established its key objectives: increased energy efficiency, environmental protection, the exploitation of national resources, the diversification of sources of supply from abroad, and the overall competitiveness of the production system.[71][72][73][74] Between 1990 and 2000, the Italian electricity market was progressively liberalized.[71]  In 1991, Law No. 9/1991 sanctioned a first partial liberalisation of the production of electricity generated from conventional sources and renewable energy sources; companies were allowed to produce electricity for their own use with an obligation to hand over the excess amount to Enel.[71][75] In July 1992, the Amato I Cabinet turned Enel into a joint-stock company with the Treasury as the sole shareholder.[76] In 1999, the D'Alema I Cabinet issued Legislative Decree no. 79 of 16 March 1999 (known as the Bersani Decree) to liberalise the electricity sector. This opened up the possibility for other actors to operate in the energy market. Enel\u2014which had so far been the only actor in the production, distribution, and sale of electricity in Italy\u2014had now to change its corporate structure by distinguishing the three phases and constituting itself as three different companies: Enel Produzione, Enel Distribuzione, and Terna, respectively, for energy production, distribution, and transmission. Moreover, Enel could produce  only 50% of the national production according to the new law.[77][78][79][80][77] In 1999, 31.7% of the company, in its new structure, was privatised. Following privatization, Enel was put on the stock market; its shares were listed on the Italian Stock Exchange with a value of \u20ac4.3 per share; the total number was 4,183\u00a0million shares for a total value of \u20ac18\u00a0billion.[81][82] In this period Enel was involved in several new projects. In 1993, the company built the Serre photovoltaic plant. At the time, this was largest of its kind in Europe with an installed capacity of 3.3 megawatts.[83] In 1997, Enel, Orange S.A., and Deutsche Telekom funded Wind Telecomunicazioni as a joint venture, a mobile and fixed telecom operator.[84] In 2000, Enel launched a project to connect Italy's and Greece\u2019s power grids by laying a 160\u00a0km underwater power line, capable of carrying 600 megawatts, to connect Otranto (Apulia) with the Greek city of Aetos. The project, completed in 2002, had a total cost of \u20ac339\u00a0million.[85][86][87] During the 2000s, the company worked to reduce the environmental impact of the production of energy and on a progressive internationalization of Enel through a number of mergers and acquisitions.[88][89] In 2000, Enel signed an agreement with the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economic Development in which the company committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 13.5% before 2002, and by 20% before 2006.[90] That year, Enel acquired CHI Energy, a renewable energy producer operating in the US and Canadian markets, for $170\u00a0million.[91] In the following years, Enel continued investing in renewable energy and clean technologies. In 2004, the company was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a stock market index that evaluates the financial performance of companies based on economic, environmental, and social performance.[92] In 2008, Enel formed Enel Green Power, a company dedicated to developing and managing the production of power from renewable energy.[93] In 2009, Enel launched the Archilede project, a new urban lighting system chosen by 1600 municipalities. This new intelligent lighting technology resulted in approximately 26\u00a0GWh per year of energy saving, and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 18,000 tons per year.[94] That same year, the company opened a new photovoltaic power station in the Park of Villa di Pratolino, in Florence. The project - called \"Diamante\" \u2013 was to build a plant capable of storing, as hydrogen, enough of the solar energy accumulated during the day to meet nighttime requirements.[95] In 2010, the Archimede combined cycle power plant became operational at Priolo Gargallo, near Syracuse in Sicily. This was the first thermal solar field to use molten salt\u2013technology integrated with a combined cycle gas facility.[96] Enel had several acquisitions and divestments in this period. In 2001, the company won the tender offer for the purchase of Viesgo\u2014a subsidiary of Endesa\u2014a company active on the Spanish market in the production and distribution of electricity, with a net installed capacity of 2400 megawatts.[97]  In 2002, Enel divested Eurogen SpA, Elettrogen SpA, and Interpower SpA in compliance with the Bersani Decree provisions on the liberalization of electricity production.[98][99] In 2001, Enel acquired Infostrada\u2014previously a subsidiary of Vodafone, at a cost of 7.25\u00a0billion euros. Infostrada was later merged with Wind, with 17\u00a0million customers.[clarification needed][100][101] In 2005, Enel assigned 62.75% ownership of Wind to Weather Investments S.a.r.l., a company belonging to the Egyptian businessman Naguib Sawiris, at the time CEO of Global Telecom Holding (the remaining 37.25% was divested in 2006).[102] In 2008 and 2009, Enel Stoccaggi and Enel Rete Gas were sold to investors, mainly Primo Fondo Italiano per le Infrastrutture. This period was marked by the appointment of a new board of directors that set the reorganisation of assets abroad and reducing the company's debt as the main priorities for the future. In 2011, Enel opened the first pilot carbon dioxide\u2013capture facility in Italy, in the area of Brindisi, in the existing power plant ENEL Federico II.[119] That year Enel Distribuzione built its first Smart grid in Isernia, a grid capable of effectively adjusting the two-way flow of electricity generated from renewable sources. The total investment for this project was \u20ac10\u00a0million.[120] Also in 2011, Enel became part of the United Nations Global Compact, a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable policies worldwide,[121] and signed a cooperation framework agreement with the World Food Programme, to fight against world hunger and climate change. The cost of the project was \u20ac8\u00a0million, which included the production and distribution of high-efficiency cooking stoves, the installation of photovoltaic systems in the all WFP logistical premises, and giving support to humanitarian interventions.[122][123][124] In the same year the company was added to the FTSE4Good Index of the London Stock Exchange which measures businesses' behaviour in terms of environmental sustainability, relationships with stakeholders, human rights, the quality of working conditions, and fighting against corruption.[125][126] In 2012, Enel sold the remaining 5.1% of Terna in its possession, thus exiting completely from the high-voltage market.[127] In 2013 Enel signed an agreement, in Sochi, for the sale of 40% of Arctic Russia, a joint venture with Eni, which in turn controlled 49% of SeverEnergia, for $1.8\u00a0billion.[128][129] In May 2014, Maria Patrizia Grieco was elected president of the board of directors; and Francesco Starace was appointed CEO.[130]  The company's main objectives were set to be the reorganisation of activities in Iberia and Latin America and debt reduction.[131][132] In 2014, Enel\u2014together with Endesa, Accelerace, and FundingBox\u2014initiated the INCENSe program (Internet Cleantech Enablers Spark), which was co-funded by the European Commission, for the promotion of technological innovation in renewable energy, and was joined by over 250 start-ups from 30 countries in 2015.[133][134][135] In 2014 and 2015, Enel was included in the STOXX Global ESG Governance Leaders index, an index that measures a company's environmental, social, and governance practices.[136][137] Enel took part in Expo 2015 in Milan as an Official Global Partner.  With a \u20ac29\u00a0million investment, as well as building its own pavilion, Enel built a Smart City over the entire Expo area, simulating a city of 100,000 inhabitants with a total energy consumption of 1\u00a0GWh per day.[138][139] The Smart City comprised a smart grid for the distribution of electricity, an operations center for the monitoring and management of the smart grid, an information system that allowed visitors to view in real-time the electricity consumption in each pavilion, charging stations for electric vehicles,[140] and LED lighting of the entire exhibition site.[140] Enel produces electricity from a number of energy sources including geothermal, wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power, thermal, and nuclear power.  In 2014, Enel generated a total of 283.1\u00a0TWh of electricity, distributed 395.4\u00a0TWh, and sold 261\u00a0TWh. Enel is also engaged in research and development activities for the production and transmission of electricity. These include: Enel is headquartered in Rome and has been listed on the Milan stock exchange since 1999.  Enel and its subsidiaries produce and distribute electricity and gas in 30 countries around Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Africa.[146][147] The company employs around 70,000 people, has over 60\u00a0million customers worldwide (56\u00a0million in the electricity market, and 6\u00a0million in the gas market) and a net installed generating capacity of over 89 GW.  Enel is the largest energy company in Europe by number of customers and the second by capacity, after EdF.[146][148][149][150] The Enel Group is organised in five divisions: For trading on international markets, as well as for the procurement and sale of energy products including gas, Enel owns 100% of Enel Trade, which in turn owns 100% of Enel Trade Romania, Enel Trade Croatia, and Enel Trade Serbia.[25][155] Through Enel Trade, Enel also owns Nuove Energie, a company that specialises in the construction of regasification plants.[25][155][156] In Italy, Enel owns companies that produce, distribute and resell electricity:[155] In France, Enel owns 5% of the French energy exchange Powernext.[160] In Spain, through its subsidiary Enel Iberoamerica (previously known as Enel Energy Europe[161]), Enel holds 70.1% of Endesa, acquired in 2009 with an initial stake of 92%.[162] The acquisition earned Enel the 2009 Platts Global Energy Award for \"Deal of the Year\".[163]  In 2016, Endesa acquired Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a from Enel for \u20ac1.207 billion.[164] Enel has been operating in Russia since 2004.[165] It owns 56.43% of Enel Russia (formerly OGK-5) and 49.5% of the electricity supplier RusEnergoSbyt, through Enel Investment Holding BV.[166][167] In 2013, Rosneft, through NGK Itera, bought  40% of Enel's stake in Arctic Russia BV, a company which owned 19.6% of SeverEnergia.[168] In Argentina, Enel holds a 37.34% share of Empresa Distribuidora Sur SA.[155][169] In Chile, Enel controls 99.91% of Empresa Electrica Panguipulli SA, 51.80% of Enel Am\u00e9ricas SA, 60.07% of Distribuci\u00f3n Chile SA, 36.36% of Generaci\u00f3n Chile SA, 99.91% of Enel Green Power Chile Ltd, 99.91% of Enel Green Power del Sur SpA, and 37% of Gas Atacama Chile SA.[170][171] In Peru, through Enersis Cile, Enel controls 39.21% of Empresa Distribuci\u00f3n Per\u00f9 SAA and 43.31% of Enel Generaci\u00f3n Per\u00fa SA.[172] Enel owns 50% of Open Fiber. According to the plan approved on 23 March 2016, operating in the so-called A and B clusters to \"market success\" as discussed by the Italian Council of Ministers on 3 March 2015, Open Fiber is to make FTTH broadband services available to 9.5 million Italian homes, in 282 communities in large urban areas, by 2022.  The areas chosen for the project are a subset of 641 communities the government classifies as A and B Clusters. The full list of the 282 communities has not yet been made public, except for the 13 cities of Bari, Cagliari, Catania, Florence, Genoa, Naples, Padova, Palermo, Perugia, Venice, Bologna, Milan, and Turin. Open Fiber has been selected by Infratel to make fibre optic networks available in the so-called \"white\" areas in Abruzzo, Molise, Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Tuscany, Veneto, Piedmont, Valle d'Aosta, Liguria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, the autonomous province of Trento, Campania, Basilicata, Marche, Umbria, Lazio, and Sicily. Elisabetta Ripa took over as CEO in January 2018.[173][174] eMotorWerks is a \"supplier of electric vehicle (EV) Charging stations, called JuiceBox, and owner and operator of JuiceNet, an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the smart management of EV charging and other distributed energy storage facilities\".[175] It was acquired by Enel in October 2017. Enel's presence is global: in Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Romania, France, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland), in North America (Canada and the United States), Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Uruguay), in Oceania (Australia), and Asia (India, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan).[176] In Italy, Enel operates in the following fields: Following the liberalisation of the market, Enel can no longer produce more than 50% of the total electricity produced in Italy;[182] and like all other providers, is bound by the Universal Service Act, and by European standards, to connect to the grid anyone who requests service. Generally, Enel is subject to the supervision and decisions of the Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Network, and the Environment\u00a0[it].[183][184] Through its subsidiaries, Enel engages internationally in the following activities and areas: In the United States of America and Canada, Enel produces hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and biomass energy for a total capacity of 2,100 MW (2,020 MW in the US and 80 MW in Canada).[212][213] Enel Green Power was the second largest producer of solar energy in Latin America in 2014.  Projects scheduled for the coming years are going to increase photovoltaic production tenfold, turning the company into the largest photovoltaics manufacturer in the region.[214] On 11 November 2014, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma filed suit against Enel's subsidiary Osage Wind LLC, an 84-turbine industrial wind project in Osage County, Okla.[245] In the suit, the United States alleges that Enel and Osage Wind are illegally converting minerals owned by the Osage Nation, a Native American tribe that has owned all mineral rights in the county since 1871.[246] The suit says that Osage Wind should have obtained a permit from the Bureau of Indian Affairs before mining rock and other material for the pits in which turbine bases are built. The United States asked that all excavating on the 8,500 acre site cease and that dozens of turbines that are already being erected be removed.[247] Osage Wind has insisted that it is not mining and needs no permit. The company says that it has already spent nearly $300\u00a0million on the project, which is being built on privately-owned fee land, not land held in trust for American Indians.[245] Osage Wind LLC and a second and adjacent Enel wind project, Mustang Run, are also embroiled in cases pending before the Oklahoma Supreme Court in which the Osage Nation and Osage County, Oklahoma, are challenging the constitutional legitimacy of permits for both projects.[248][249] Enel had to exit the El Salvador electricity market after a long dispute with the Government of El Salvador.[250]  Article 109 of the Constitution of El Salvador states that underground natural resources are the country's property and the government should not allow a foreign company to be the sole proprietor of geothermic generation. Both parties came to a settlement in 2014, but no details have been released. Enel had been demanding over EUR 94\u00a0million from the Ministry of Economy of Slovakia in compensation for lost earnings it claims to have incurred as price proposals were rejected by the Slovakian Regulatory Office for Network Industries (URSO).[251] ",

Considered one of the global supermajors, it has operations in 79 countries, and is currently world's 11th largest industrial company with a market capitalization of 68 billion euros (US$ 90 billion), as of August 14, 2013.[2] The Italian government owns a 30.303% golden share in the company, 3.934% held through the state Treasury and 26.369% held through the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. Another 2.012% of the shares are held by the People's Bank of China.[3] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] The name \"ENI\" was initially the acronym of \"Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi\" (National Hydrocarbons Authority). Through the years after its foundation however, it operated in many fields including contracting, nuclear power, energy, mining, chemicals and plastics, refining/extraction and distribution machinery, hospitality industry and even textile industry and news. Eni constantly ranks among the top 100 on Fortune Global 500 list for largest companies by revenue. In 2016, the company holds the 65th place, a fall of 40 places from the previous year's 25th rank.[5] In terms of share capitalisation (the market value of shares), Eni is ranked eighth in comparison with the principal companies operating in the same sector: Exxon, Shell, Chevron, Total, BP, ConocoPhillips, Equinor, Anadarko, Apache and Marathon Oil.[6] Eni was founded and established by law in 1953 from an existing company, Agip, which was created in 1926 with the aim to explore for oilfields, acquire and commercialize oil and derivatives.[8][9]  In March 1953, Enrico Mattei was nominated Eni's Chairman.[10][11] Eni originally was an acronym for the company's full title Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (National Hydrocarbons Authority).[12]  After 1995, the meaning ceased to be relevant but the name was maintained.[13] In 1952, the logo of the then nascent Eni was selected. The logo is a six-legged dog, an imaginary animal symbolizing the sum of a car's four wheels and the two legs of its driver.[14][15] Starting in 1954, Eni acquired extensive exploration rights in North Africa, signing an agreement with the Egyptian government led by Nasser while providing an active and equal role for the crude producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures.[12][16][17] In 1957 Eni pushed for a similar agreement, known as the \"Mattei formula\",[18][19] to be signed with Persian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the National Iranian Oil Company.[20][21][22] In 1960, during the Cold War period, Eni signed an agreement with the Soviet Union for the importation of Russian crude at low prices.[23][24] On 27 October 1962, Enrico Mattei's airplane mysteriously exploded near Bascap\u00e8, on his way to Milan from Catania.[25][26]  His death was initially considered an accident, but later it was confirmed to be a murder with the aim to protect and hide important economical and political interests in Italy and especially abroad, as it is clearly stated in the records of the trial on the assassination of the journalist Mauro De Mauro, who was investigating on the death of Enrico Mattei.[27] During the following years, Eni signed joint venture contracts with foreign companies to supply crude from Egypt to Iran and from Libya to Tunisia.[28] In 1963, Eni acquired a majority stake in Italgas.[29] In October 1973 after the Yom Kippur War and the OPEC embargo[30][31] against the United States and the Netherlands by OPEC members and  Arab countries, a serious his oil crisis occurred,[32] causing Eni to consolidate its position in the international market by signing an agreement with Sonatrach,[33] the Algerian state oil entity for natural gas supply.[34] In 1974 Eni signed an agreement with the Libyan government, followed by additional agreements with Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia.[35][36][37][38] During the mid-1970s, Eni planned a major infrastructure for transporting natural gas over long distances, by building a pipeline network of thousands of miles throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.[39][40][41] After the inauguration of the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline connecting Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia,[42] Eni signs a new agreement with Libya for the exploitation of Bo\u00f9ri,[43] the biggest oilfield in the centre of the Mediterranean,[44] and develops its international role within the oil industry.[45] In 1992 Eni became a joint stock company by Law Decree,[46][47][48][49][50] and was listed to the Italian and New York Stock Exchange in 1995.[51][52][53] From 1995 to 1998 Eni put four share offers fully successfully, as 70% of its capital assets were sold to private shareholders.[54][55][56] As the price of oil collapsed in 1998 as other major companies Eni got to turn into a race through merges, international acquisitions, new explorations and the foundation of real super-companies.[57][58][59] Since 2000, Eni has been developing the Kashagan[60] oilfield a major offshore discovery, along the Caspian Sea.[61][62] In 2005 the Blue Stream pipeline projected to supply gas from southern Russia to Turkey was inaugurated as a joint venture between Eni and Gazprom.[63][64][65] In 2007 Eni signed an agreement to conduct South Stream a feasibility study with Gazprom to import Russian gas into Europe across the Black Sea.[66][67][68] Activist asset manager Knight Vinke, who owns 1% of the outstanding shares of the company, begun pressuring Eni's management to operate a spin-off of Eni's gas activities. In its opinion this would solve the undervaluation of the company and release up to 50 billion euros ($70bn) of hidden value.[69] In 2010 Eni achieves key production milestone in Iraqi Zubair oil field.[70][71][72] After getting a licence in 2006 for the exploration of an offshore area in the north of Mozambique, known as Area 4,[73][74][75] Eni announced several major natural gas discoveries between 2011 and 2012 such as Mamba South,[76][77][78][79][80][81] Mamba North,[82][83] Mamba North East,[84][85][86][87] Coral 1.[88][89][90][91] In February 2014, ENI discovered oil at its DRC offshore block.[92] Since 2012 Eni has been selling off refining and marketing assets it owned in eastern Europe in order to increase profitability. By 2013 Eni already reduced its refining capacity by 13 percent. In May 2014 Eni agreed to sell their 32.5% share in \u010cesk\u00e1 rafinersk\u00e1 a.s. (CRC), a refining company in Czech Republic, to MOL Group of Hungary.[93] In June 2014 the company signed an agreement with Sasol to acquire a 40% interest in a permit to explore 82,000-km2 offshore of South Africa's east coast.[94] In January 2015, Eni in collaboration with Vitol Energy signed a $7 billion contract with the government of Ghana. This agreement was reached in order to produce oil and gas at Cape Three Points in the Western Region of Ghana, in an attempt to enable Ghana to meet its power and energy needs. In August 2015 Eni announced the discovery of a huge gasfield off the coast of Egypt.[95] In July 2017, the oil giant accepted responsibility for an oil spill affecting the Fylde coast of Blackpool in the United Kingdom.[96] In March 2018, Eni reached an agreement with MIT to fund fusion research projects run out of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC)\u2019s newly created Laboratory for Innovation in Fusion Technologies (LIFT). The expected investment in these research projects will amount to about $2 million over the following years.[97] As exploration and reserve replacement being major drivers for the company,[99] Eni boosts for production additions in its core oil field areas (North and Sub-Saharan Africa,[100][101][102][103] Venezuela,[104][105] Barents Sea,[106][107] Yamal Peninsula,[108][109] Kazakhstan,[110][111] Iraq[112] and the Far East).[113][114] Eni has about 130 exploration and production subsidiaries,[115] such as Eni Norge.[116] In 2012 Eni reported liquids and gas production for the full year of 1,701 kboe/d, this being calculated assuming a natural gas conversion factor to barrel equivalent, updated to 5,492 cubic feet of gas equal 1 barrel of oil from July 1, 2012.[99][117] During 2012 60 new exploratory wells were drilled, as 56 were drilled in 2011 and 47 in 2010. The overall commercial success rate was 40% (40.8% net to Eni) as compared to 42% in 2011 (38.6% net to Eni) and 41% in 2010 (39% net to Eni). In 2012 351 development wells were drilled as well, as 407 in 2011 and 399 in 2010.[118][119][120] In 2012, sales of natural gas were 95.32 bcm, down 1.44 bcm compared to 2011.[121][122][123] Eni's power generation sites are located in Ferrera Erbognone, Ravenna, Livorno, Taranto, Mantova, Brindisi, Ferrara and Bolgiano.[124][125] In 2012, Eni's power generation was 25.67 TWh.[126][127] Overall Eni supplies 2,600 customers including large companies, power generation companies, wholesalers and distributors of natural gas for automotive use. Residential users are 7.45 million and include households, professionals, small and medium size enterprises, and public bodies located all over Italy and 2.09 million customers in European Countries. International sales include Iberian Peninsula, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Hungary, UK/Northern Europe, Turkey, France markets.[128][129][130][131][132] Eni's electricity generation sites in Italy, as of January 2010, are the following:[133] Eni is the leader operator in refining and marketing of petroleum products in Italy.[134][135] Eni is engaged in retail and wholesales activities in Central-Eastern European countries also (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Hungary).[136][137][138][139] Retail sales operations are conducted under the Eni and Agip brands. The re-branding of Eni's service stations in Italy and in the rest of Europe to Eni brand is underway.[134][140][141] Eni operates in engineering, construction and drilling both offshore and onshore for the oil&gas industry through the subsidiary Saipem.[142] In April 2012, Eni in collaboration with ZEiTECS announced the world's first offshore rigless/wireline retrievable ESP system for Eni Congo.[143] Eni's principal subsidiaries include: The Central Energy Italian Gas Holding scandal in 2005 involved Eni and Gazprom.[147] In 2009, the European Commission filed formal antitrust charges against Eni. The commission believes that Eni has conspired to keep competitors from using its gas pipelines.[148] In 2009 again, according to the WikiLeaks cables, US ambassador Lanier told Washington that bribery allegations were made in Uganda by Eni which at the time was in competition for oil assets in the country against Tullow Oil. The bribes were taken by the newly appointed Ugandan prime minister, Amama Mbabazi.[149] After corruption charges against the subsidiary Saipem, Eni's CFO Alessandro Bernini had to resign and the new CFO Massimo Mondazzi took over in December 2012.[150] Eni and Royal Dutch Shell will stand trial in Italy over allegations of corruption in the 2011 purchase of a big offshore oil field in Nigeria known as OPL 245.

Founded by Ermenegildo Zegna in 1910, in Trivero, Piedmont, Ermenegildo Zegna is one of the most renowned business in Italy.[1]  Prior to the founding of the company, founder Ermenegildo Zegna's father Angelo \u2013 a former watchmaker \u2013 owned a wool mill and looms in the Alps of Piedmont, Italy.[2] Ermenegildo, together with his brothers Edoardo and Mario, founded the company in 1910 in Trivero in the Biellese Alps when he was only 18, utilizing his father's looms and assets.[3][4] In 1915 the company was renamed Fratelli Zegna di Angelo.[5]Zegna\u2019s vision was to create high-quality fabrics, so he began to source wool directly from several countries around the world, such as Mongolia, Australia, South Africa;[4]\u00a0he also bought modern machinery from England.[1] During the Interwar period, Zegna\u2019s business started to flourish. In the late 1920s, the Lanificio (wool mill) employed more than 700 workers,[4] growing to more than 1,000 in the late 1930s.[6] In 1938 the company began to export fabrics in the U.S. through its subsidiary Zegna Woollens Corporation established in New York.[4] In 1942, Ermenegildo\u2019s sons Aldo (born in 1920) and Angelo (born in 1924) entered the company, which was renamed Ermenegildo Zegna and Sons.[6][7][8] In the mid-1950s, the company employed 1,400 workers.[6] Ermenegildo Zegna\u2019s sons, Aldo and Angelo, took over the company in the mid-1960s.[4] Under their guide, the label both expanded its business to ready-made suits and established new plants and distribution network abroad. In 1968, the first factory producing sleeve-units and trousers was opened in Novara, followed by openings in Spain, Greece, and Switzerland.[4][6] Sales and marketing departments were also established in France, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S.[4] In 1972, Zegna launched its made-to-measure service called Su Misura.[4] Zegna\u2019s attention to wool quality continued through 1960s and 1970s, as the company established the Wool Awards in Australia (1963) and the Mohair Trophy in South Africa (1970).[9][10] The international development strategy run by the Zegna brothers brought to the openings of the first owned boutique in Paris in 1980, followed by Milan in 1985.[6] In 1991 Zegna became the first luxury label to open a store in China.[11] During the 1990s, the third generation of the Zegna family entered the business. Angelo\u2019s son, and namesake of the company\u2019s founder, Ermenegildo \u201cGildo\u201d Zegna, became CEO of the Group in 1997;[12] his cousin Paolo became the chairman.[3] They are still at the helm today. Under their governance, the company began a strategy of brand extension and full verticalization.[6][7] In 1991 Zegna was the first luxury brand to enter the China market, with a flagship store in Beijing;[13][14] and one of the first to access the Indian market.[15] In 2008, the Group established its new headquarters in Milan, in a building designed by architects Antonio Citterio and Gianmaria Beretta. Moreover, a large number of acquisitions and partnerships have been signed since the late 1990s to the present day.  In 1999, Zegna launched in womenswear by acquiring the Italian brand Agnona.[4][16] In 2014, Zegna acquired the majority of Achill, an Australian wool farm counting about 12,500 sheep in its flock.[17] In 2016, the Group acquired a majority stake in Bonotto, a high-end textile manufacturer based in Molvena, Vicenza, Italy, giving the Group the possibility to explore new areas such as furnishing and experimental fabrics.[18] Two years later, Zegna \u2013 through its subsidiary ZECA company \u2013 took over the historic Cappellificio Cervo hat-maker.[19] In 2018, Ermenegildo Zegna Group \u2013 already present in India with three stores \u2013 together with Reliance, acquired a stake into Indian fashion designer Raghavendra Rathore\u2019s firm.[20] In the same year Zegna announced that they purchased 85% of the eponymously named Thom Browne, a New York City-based menswear and womenswear brand, founded in 2001.[21] In 2019, Zegna bought a 65% stake of Italian high-quality jersey fabrics manufacturer Dondi, increasing its control over the textile supply chain.[22][23] Ermenegildo Zegna Group, that entered the fragrances market in 2003,[4] signed a worldwide licensing agreement with Est\u00e9e Lauder on its fragrance line in 2011.[24] Recent lines include the Essenze Eau de Parfum collection launched in 2019.[25] Zegna have also been in partnership with famous Italian luxury vehicle manufacturer Maserati since 2013, in order to produce custom-kitted interior, as well as several collections of leather goods, travel-friendly clothing and personal accessories.[26][27][28] In February 2014, the Ermenegildo Zegna Group signed a ten-year licensing agreement for the manufacture of eyewear with the Marcolin Group.[29] Alessandro Sartori oversees creative direction for all departments of the brand. He was appointed as artistic director in June 2016, when he came back to Zegna after serving the label from 2003 to 2011 as creative director.[30][31] Previously, Stefano Pilati had served as head of design of Ermenegildo Zegna Couture for three years.[32] From 2011 to 2014, Paul Surridge was creative director of Z Zegna.[33] Ermenegildo Zegna Group is the largest menswear brand in the world by revenue.[34][35] As of 2018, Ermenegildo Zegna operated 480 retail stores (267 of which company-owned) across the world. Following the company\u2019s strongly export-oriented strategy, exports account for over 90% of total sales.[36][37] Zegna is now managed by the third generation of the Zegna family and remains in family ownership. Ermenegildo (Gildo) Zegna is currently the CEO; his cousin Paolo Zegna is the company\u2019s Chairman; Anna Zegna is President of Fondazione Zegna. Ermenegildo\u2019s son, Angelo, is the honorary Chairman.[1] A number of actors and models have advertised Zegna\u2019s lines through the years. Celebrities featured in Zegna\u2019s advertising campaigns include Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody,[38] American model Ryan Burns,[39] Irish actor Jamie Dornan,[40] English actor Sam Riley.[41] In 2017, Ermenegildo Zegna launched a four-chapter campaign called Defining Moments.[42] The campaign featured Robert De Niro, McCaul Lombardi, Benjamin Millepied, Park Chan-wook, Yoo Ji-Tae, Wang Deshun, Sunny Wang, Javier Bardem, Dev Patel.[43] The first three chapters were directed by Craig McDean; the last one was directed by Luca Guadagnino.[44] In 2019 Zegna launched the new \u201cWhat does it mean to be a man today?\u201d, campaign, featuring Mahershala Ali and Nicholas Tse, focused on the definition of modern masculinity.[45]   Zegna also produced a four-part series of short films titled A Rose Reborn, directed by Park Chan-wook in 2014.[46][47]American actor Adrien Brody modeled for Zegna in 2003 British actor Sam Riley modeled Ermenegildo Zegna Couture autumn/winter 2015 British actor Jamie Dornan modeled Ermenegildo Zegna Couture spring/summer 2014 American actor McCaul Lombardi appeared in Zegna's 2017 campaign.  During the 1930s, founder Ermenegildo Zegna actively promoted social facilities in his native town Trivero.[48]\u00a0Before the advent of popular ecology, he also planted thousands of trees and financed the panoramic road which was named after him.[49][50][51] In 1993, Ermenegildo Zegna Group created the Oasi Zegna, a protected natural area of 100 km2 in the mountains surrounding Trivero. In 2014 the Oasi was granted the patronage of FAI Fondo Ambiente Italiano, the National Trust of Italy.[52] In 2000 a charity organization, Fondazione Zegna, was set up with the aim of promoting sustainability and environmental causes, to which the Group puts 5% of its profits.[53][54] Since 2014, the Group has been financing the 25-year project called the Ermenegildo Zegna Founder\u2019s Scholarship. The program provides \u20ac1 million annually to enable talented Italian graduates to pursue international postgraduate studies, while encouraging them to return to Italy upon completion of their programs abroad.[55][56] ",

Etro was founded in 1968 by Gerolamo \"Gimmo\" Etro[1] as a textile design company.[2][3] The main stylistic driver for Etro over its first decades was the paisley pattern, and variations on this theme.[4] The company's headquarters is located in Milan on Via Spartaco, and was refurbished in 1977.[5] The headquarters includes textile art archived in their in-house library.[6] Future textiles head Jacopo Etro[7] later commented on this period, stating that he had started to visit the archive when he was a child, spending many hours copying the fabric designs and experimenting with his own creative style.[8] After a trip to India made by Etro executives, the furnishing textiles line made its debut in 1981.[9] The \"swirling\" paisley design found on this trip is now \"synonymous\" with the label according to Elle Magazine.[10] The company began producing Leather goods in 1984 crafted from Paisley Jacquard fabrics.[11] Etro then began its home collection in 1985.[12] The Fragrances collection was launched in 1989, making its debut in the Milanese Fragrances flagship boutique, located on Via Verri. More recent additions of the line include Rajasthan[13] and Jacquard.[14] Etro's first fashion show at Milan Fashion Week was held in 1996.[15] The company began sales by direct-mail through inserts in The New York Times starting in 1999,[16] and Etro began selling its clothing online in addition to in retail stores in 2013.[17] In 2014, a monograph on the company's history entitled Etro was published by Rizzoli publishing house.[18] Etro is identified primarily with Gimmo (born Gerolamo), the founder, however the company is managed by his four children.[19] Kean Etro is the creative director of the Etro Man collections, sometimes inspired by his travels and antique book collection.[20] He joined the family business in 1986 as a digital intern. In 1990 he designed his first menswear collection, and in 1996 he produced a fashion show focused on the concept of \"New Tradition\".[21] Veronica Etro is the creative director of the Etro Woman collections.[22] She unveiled her first womenswear collection in 2000.[23] Jacopo Etro has been working for the family business since 1982, eventually becoming the Creative Director of the Etro Accessories, Leather, Home and Textile collections, as well as Head of Communication. In 2010, he was also invited to sit on the board of the Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana as the delegate for the Italian textile industry.[24] Ippolito Etro joined the company in 1991, overseeing the Administration Department before his promotion to General Director.[25] He was quoted by The New York Times stating that, \"My father always told us that we could do what we wanted in life. But he said, 'If you work here, you have to start from scratch'\".[26] The menswear collection has been presented through conceptual catwalk shows, including the Autumn Winter 03 collection that had guests ride on a 1937 steam train through urban Milan, with the models walking through the cabins.[27] Other pieces have included \"cooked\" shirts, where the pieces are dyed with berries or other food-stuffs in order to produce their intended designs.[28] The womenswear line was launched in 1991.[29] For the Spring - Summer 2016 womenswear collection presented in Milan, Angelo Flaccavento wrote that it \"show[ed] off the savoir-faire of her ateliers\", using a ballerina-lingerie theme. He wrote further of the lighter direction the collection moved in from previous seasons that, \"Everything had a charming, undone quality that looked appealing and felt new.\"[30]  The New York Times called the collection an \"ode to turn-of-the-century femininity\", also mentioning the strong influence of dance throughout the show.[31] The company also has a line of fragrances, some using the theme of \"ancient perfumery\".[32] Other collections include toiletries, leathergoods, travel accessories, eyewear,[4] footwear,[29] jewelry,[33] and home furnishings.[34] In 2014, the company opened its first Etro Home store in Milan during the Salone del Mobile.[35] ",

Medium-haul activity was centered mainly on operations to Egypt and the Red Sea Riviera, Spain and Greece. Long haul included some of Italians\u2019 preferred tropical destinations like the Maldives and Sri Lanka or Africa. Furthermore, during the summer season, Eurofly operated non-stop scheduled flights to New York City, exploiting the reverse seasonality of if compared to tropical destinations and focusing on incoming traffic to Italy. In 2010, the airline merged with Meridiana to form Meridiana fly (but returned to its name Meridiana after merging with Air Italy). The airline was established on 26 May 1989 with the aim of selling medium haul flights to tour operators. Eurofly started its  operations on 26 February 1990. It was set up with a 45% shareholding by Alitalia in response to the needs of the flag carrier to develop the leisure travel market. The original shareholding was divided between Alitalia (45%), Olivetti (45%) and San Paolo Finance (10%). There have been several changes of ownership since.[2] At the end of 2006, Spinnaker sold a 29,95% stake in Eurofly capital to Meridiana. Mr Giovanni Rossi (CEO of Meridiana) became CEO of Eurofly. In January 2008, two capital increases took place and Meridiana participation in Eurofly's capital grew to 46.1%. On 28 February 2010, Meridiana and Eurofly merged to create Italy's second biggest airline. The new airline is called Meridiana fly (Later Replaced & Return To Meridiana former name after the Merge Of Air Italy). For now both airlines aircraft will continue to carry their individual logos. However Eurofly's GJ code will immediately disappear and be replaced by Meridiana's IG code.[3] By 2013 & 2014, All Of Eurofly Airbus fleet that was merged with Meridiana to create Meridiana Fly (later to return to its former name Meridiana after merging with Air Italy) were by Boeing aircraft to pursue the aim of operating an all Boeing fleet together with Air Italy. All Airbus aircraft Eurofly formerly owned are currently still flying under its new owners.[4] The Eurofly fleet consisted of the following aircraft (as of February 2010). As of 4 July 2009, the average age of the Eurofly fleet was 6.8 years.[5] ",

Shortly after founding it transferred to Genoa and then in 1909 it merged with Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili (S.P.A.) in Turin.[2] The company was established in 1905 by investors in La Spezia, Liguria, Italy to produce large, prestigious, luxury vehicles, but shortly after founding it transferred to Genoa. The lack of technical skills in the Genoese workforce forced the company to seek business partners, and resulted in both the 1907 closure of the Genoa plant and the 1909 merger with the Turin automobile manufacturer Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili (SPA). The new company traded as Societ\u00e0 Ligure Piemontese Automobili.[2] The company was also the Italian agent for Thornycroft vehicles.[1] The emphasis on quality meant that steel was imported from Krupp in Germany and vehicle testing was extensive, but lack of technical skills in the workforce resulted in both the 1907 closure of the Genoa plant and the 1909 transfer of manufacturing to the Turin manufacturer Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili (SPA).[2] The initial cars were a 12/16\u00a0hp and 16/24\u00a0hp, both with four-cylinder engines and shaft drive. Later they added a 40\u00a0hp model with chain drive. All engines had the cylinders cast in pairs.[1] The range was expanded with six-cylinder models rated as 40 and 70\u00a0hp.[2] In 1906 the Marchese Giovanni Battista Raggio  won the Circuito Bresciano with a \"FLAG 6S/40\". F.L.A.G. initially entered 3 cars for the 1907 I Kaiser Preis held on 13\u201314 June in the Taunus mountains, but only Carlo Raggio was named and no vehicles started.[3] ",

Today Fabbri forms part of Rizzoli Libri, which in turn is 100% controlled by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Coming from a family of small bourgeois merchants Forlivesi, the brothers Fabbri started with little more than a love for art and culture inherited from their father Ottavio Fabbri. The eldest, Giovanni, just graduated from medical school joined the partisan of the Val d'Ossola. After the war, preferring books to the medical profession, he decided to take up a career of the editor, managing to involve his brothers. The \"Fratelli Fabbri Editori\" found immediate success printing text books for schools and, later, became the leading publisher in this area. They took a leap in the quality of printing to publish regular, large classical works such as The Divine Comedy and The Bible. The approval of the public encouraged them, and at the end of the fifties remain in the history of publishing with works such as \"Masterpieces in the Centuries\" and, particularly, \"The Masters of Color.\" (I Maestri del Colore). In the 1960s \"Fratelli Fabbri Editori\" published Conoscere, an illustrated encyclopedia for children that entered the homes of millions of Italians. The encyclopedia was sold in bound volumes, with payment by installments. During those years, the publishing house sold approximately a billion and a half books, published in dozens of countries with translations into 14 languages, including Hindi, Urdu, Afrikaans, Turkish and Bulgarian. They were also the first Italian publisher to market multimedia products; producing the new series \"The Stories of Sound\" and \"The History of Music, which combines the book and the record, addressing issues unknown at the time. For example, for \"The History of Music\" in order to fall within the standard packaging industry, they commissioned Philips Records to produce 10 million of the LP Special, of 20 centimeters in diameter. Towards the end of the sixties, due to the saturation of the market and social unrest, the brothers Dino and Rino sold their shares to engage in other activities abroad, thwarted by the refusal of the elder brother. In 1971 the Istituto Finanziario Industriale (IFI; predecessor of Exor) purchased 53% of the shares of Fabbri Editori on behalf of the Agnelli family from Bertelsmann.[1] Dino & Rino relocated abroad, but Giovanni remained on as chairman; the operational role was entrusted to Piero Stucchi Prinetti, acting as managing director. Towards the end of the 1970s Giovanni Fabbri entered the viewfinder of the Red Brigades and decided to move to Lugano, Switzerland, where he resides today. Rino Fabbri chose Paraguay. Dino Fabbri died following a long illness of \"ALS\" Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  on 10 December 2001 at his home in Aventura, Florida.[2]  Ettore Rino Fabbri died in Asunci\u00f3n, November 2012. Fabbri Editori was part of Gruppo Rizzoli Corriere della Sera (now RCS MediaGroup) and continues to be active in the publishing of textbooks and publications. RCS' book businesses, including Fabbri, were acquired Arnoldo Mondadori Editore in 2016.[3][4] With the spread of 'home-video (especially with the arrival of the DVD) Fabbri concluded agreements that allow it to distribute through the network of kiosks a monographic series on actors (such as the series of films of 007) and collections of the movies of Alberto Sordi and Gilberto Govi, directors and genres of film.[citation needed] ",

In the 1970s Romolo's son, Licinio Fabbri, took over direction of the company[citation needed], and expanded sales beyond Italy into the rest of the European continent.[1] The company expanded once again with the founding of FC Fabbri Park Sr in 1990's, with the goal of reaching out to the world market.[1] After years of producing many different rides, the Fabbri Group entered the roller coaster market no later than 1998, with the introduction of a Wacky-Worm type ride.[2] In more recent years, the company has found success in producing large thrill rides such as the Booster, a pendulum ride which has sold over 50 units since 2000.[1] Rather than having one central facility for manufacturing, the Fabbri Group has several facilities that each specialize in their own type of ride, all of which are located in nearby towns.[1] The Fabbri Group offers a large selection of rides, ranging small children's rides to large roller coasters. Some of their notable attractions include:  As of 2019, Fabbri has built 24 roller coasters around the world.[21] ",

The most significant was the delivery of pressurized water through a mechanical pump at approximately 9 bar (130.5 pounds per square inch), replacing the piston-lever designs of the 1950s. Faema circumvented the problem of running heated water through the pump, by running cold water through the pump, through a heat exchange tube through the steam boiler to flash heat the water, before entering the diffusion block and through the ground coffee to create an espresso. Faema also introduced a new grouphead that was kept warm by circulating water from the boiler through the grouphead in a thermosyphon circuit.  The grouphead was activated by a lever, which when partially open, allows the release of pressure created from the municipal water line.  That pressure soaked the coffee with brew-temperature water, allowing for a smoother extraction.  When the lever is fully raised, the pump is activated and the coffee is extracted at full pressure.   The implications of the technological innovation of the E61 was revolutionary, and allowed Faema to acquire a significant espresso machine market share within years.[citation needed] Faema recently reintroduced a replica model for commercial use. Another impact of the E61 is in the home espresso machine market.  A generic replica version of the E61 grouphead, coupled with the heat exchange boiler has become popularized in Europe, North America, and Australia.[citation needed] While the aesthetic appeal of the E61 group is cited as a reason for its popularity, the grouphead paired with a heat exchange boiler also created a new level of home espresso quality for consumers. Faema has a long history of sponsoring cycling teams. They have acted as the main or sole sponsor of numerous cycling teams for many years, but also as co-sponsor. The best-known rider competing for a team sponsored by Faema was 5-time Tour de France champion Eddy Merckx.[2] ",

It is not easy to understand that the start of Fantic depends on a coincidence, one might say as follows: \"It happened in those days that ......\". The thing was that a young Dutch salesman named Henry Keppel was sent to the United States by his employer. The employer was Italian Garelli (then the leading Italian moped manufacturer of the time) and they wanted to see if they could produce for the United States. Keppel eventually met a wholesaler in the US who said he was willing to order 10,000 mopeds of a given type - but, the wholesaler wanted his own brand name on the moped and not Garelli. The young salesman said yes and came home to Italy like a proud rooster. Then came the shock, old Mr Agrati (the owner of Garelli) would have refused to deliver a moped to the Yankees without his name, he stood up and refused to accept. What should young Keppel do? Here he stood with a binding order which, by that time, was gigantic, he jumped into it - I will do this myself! The son of old Agrati - Mario Agrati - was old with Keppel and they got along well, together they broke out, gathered some professionals who could work in the evening, contacted subcontractors, made a contract with a welding workshop, etc. Then they rented a lot of laws and set in motion, the moped should be delivered over a 2 year period, they managed it. But what then? We are building our own factory, so to speak, the year was 1968. It became Italy's most modern and rational motorcycle factory. The building was located on a large natural site, a few miles north of Monza - a few miles south of Lake Como. It was thought of rainwater (water is expensive in Italy) by constructing the roof as a water collector and installing its own wastewater treatment plant. CHP2 Fantic Motor is an Italian manufacturer of motorcycles. The company began in 1968, manufacturing and exporting enduro motorcycles, mini-bikes and go-karts. Today they continue in the same genre, though the names have changed to dual-sport and motard (supermoto), and they have returned to the US market in 2016, as Fantic USA Inc. Fantic launched in 2015 also new models of electric bikes, the Fat Bike.[1] and has now a complete line of eMTB and commuter electric bikes. Fantic began exporting to the United Kingdom in 1972, as part of a wave of manufacturers who took advantage of \"sixteener laws,\" legislation that forbade sixteen-year-old motorcyclists from riding motorcycles up to 250 cc, as they had been used to. As a result, European and Japananese manufacturers exported their sporty and lightweight below-50cc engines, which had been common in Europe, to England also. Fantic produced a \"sensational chopper moped\" and a TI (\"Tourismo Internazionale),\" both of which became very popular quickly,[2] with the reputation of being some of the fastest mopeds on the market, going as fast as 70\u00a0mph.[3] In the 1980s, Fantic enjoyed success in the Observed trials world championships, taking three titles as well as seven wins at the prestigious Scottish Six Days Trial. The Fantic Motor motorcycles were first imported into the U.K. in 1972 by Barron Eurotrade Ltd whose headquarters were based at 51 High Street Hornchurch, Essex, and the initial idea came to form the company and import the Fantic came about because one of the founders saw the 50cc 'Chopper' model publicised in an American motorcycle magazine that his brother in law sent him from the States. The U.K. market of wannabe learner drivers had several other makes of what were classed as Mopeds, (Motor and Pedals), but the Fantic T.I. quickly became a worthy contender with the rapid growth of a dealer network. The six speed gearbox was a strong selling point, and the perky Italian Minerelli 49cc engine proved to be very reliable. Stories of the T.I. model reaching 70\u00a0mph were an exaggeration, as only just over 50-55\u00a0mph could be achieved, and in the right conditions. However, the 125cc Chopper model could top 80\u00a0mph, as Terence Shea found when the model was first demonstrated to him at the Fantic factory in Bellagio, Italy. After a hefty lunch and with the wine flowing, as Terence Shea recalls, he test rode the new 125cc chopper model, reaching a top speed 130kph (80\u00a0mph). The chopper model was the original inspiration which the new U.K. importer saw as very special and distinct for a niche market, and fame grew. Part of the original marketing and advertising included a Fantic 125cc chopper model to be given to the then top comedian Dick Emery of the 'Oh, you are awful, but I like you' fame. There were many photos of Dick Emery (with Terry Shea and Frank Harris of the U.K. importer, and one was blown up very large which showed Terence Shea standing next to the 'bike with his hand on the handlebars with Dick Emery sitting on it. Another popular model was the 125cc Caballero was for on/off road, which was for a different sector of the market. The market for these types of Mopeds only lasted a handful of years. The official U.K. importers glossy studio photograph of the 125cc Chopper model was taken in London, and Terence Shea and Frank Harris of the Barron Eurotrade importer was taken from Hornchurch to London on a trailer towed by car. There was confusion in central London as to which turn to take at one particular junction on the way to the studio, which resulted in the trailer having to be unhooked and physically turned around in the narrow road and extremely busy area for the correct journey to the studio to be continued, much to the amusement of onlookers.

            "text": "Historical products: Farfisa is a manufacturer of electronics based in Osimo, Italy.[2] The Farfisa brand name is commonly associated with a series of compact electronic organs and later, a series of multi-timbral synthesizers. Today, the Farfisa brand mainly produces intercom systems with the company Aci Farfisa, which makes and distributes systems for video intercoms, access control, video surveillance, and home automation.[2] The Bontempi group owns the keyboard division Farfisa brand name.[1] At the height of its production, Farfisa operated three factories to produce instruments in Camerano in the Marche region of Italy. Farfisa also made radios, televisions, and other electronic items. The Farfisa brand name is an acronym for \"FAbbriche Riunite di FISArmoniche\", which translates to \"united factories of accordions\".[1] Farfisa began manufacturing electric organs in 1964. Distribution in the U.S. was handled by the Chicago Musical Instrument Company, which also owned Gibson, and the instruments were originally known as CMI organs when introduced there. Unlike combo organs such as the Vox Continental, Farfisa organs have integrated legs, which can be folded up and stored inside its base. The first models produced were the Compact series of organs between 1964 and 1968. The line of FAST (Farfisa All-Silicon Transistorized) organs was launched at the 1968 NAMM show,[3] and production of the Professional series appeared around the same time. Production of combo organs ended in the late 1970s after synthesizers had become more commonplace.[4] One of the first rock organists to play and spotlight the Farfisa was Domingo Samudio, known as \"Sam the Sham\", who with his group The Pharaohs had their first hit \"Wooly Bully\" in the summer of 1965. In 1966, a Farfisa was prominently heard in \"Double Shot (Of My Baby's Love)\" recorded by the South Carolina-based group The Swingin' Medallions. Spooner Oldham, the house organist of Alabama recording studio Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, can be heard playing the Farfisa on numerous southern soul recordings from the 1960s, notably \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" by Percy Sledge, among many others. The 1967 release of \"Second Best\" by The Household Sponge features a Farfisa Compact, played by Geoff Wright. Richard Wright's use of the Farfisa Compact Duo was integral to Pink Floyd's sound, the organ being his main instrument on the albums The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful of Secrets, More and Ummagumma. By 1970, he had started to use a Hammond Organ onstage and alternated between that and the Farfisa, depending on the song.[5] The Farfisa was last used on \"Dogs\" from Animals, but Wright reintroduced it to his keyboard setup on David Gilmour's 2006 tour, featured notably on the Pink Floyd song \"Echoes\". Sly Stone from Sly and the Family Stone played a Farfisa Professional, as seen at their 1969 Woodstock Festival performance. Hugh Banton from Van der Graaf Generator originally used the Farfisa Professional, applying his knowledge of electronics and contacts as a former BBC engineer to customise it with a variety of additional effects pedals, including distortion and phasing. The Professional is the only organ used on The Aerosol Grey Machine and The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other, after which he also started using Hammonds. It was retired after the group's 1972 split.[6] John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin used a Farfisa on \"Dancing Days\" from Houses of the Holy, as well as occasionally using a VIP-255 or a Professional model on stage. Another famous recording is the 1970 A Tribute to Jack Johnson by Miles Davis, where Herbie Hancock plays spontaneous licks on a broken Farfisa. Composer Philip Glass began using Farfisa organs with his ensemble in the late 1960s. With the advent of synthesizers, organs such as the classic Farfisa seemed to be headed for obsolescence, but time proved otherwise. In the late 1970s, with older models becoming cheaper, numerous punk rock and New Wave bands (especially those influenced by 1960s garage rock and psychedelia), such as Blondie, The B-52s, Suicide, Squeeze, Human Switchboard, XTC and Talking Heads embraced Farfisas as substitutes for more sophisticated keyboards and synthesizers. Their classic sound, in turn, became a staple on multitimbral instruments, first synthesized, then sampled from the originals. Numerous songs by the Industrial group Cabaret Voltaire have been known to use Farfisa drum machines and Organs.[7] \"Crocodile Rock\" by Elton John features a Farfisa organ, played by John in a honky-tonk rhythm with carnival-style riffs. The introduction of the Farfisa into West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s played an important role in evolution of Highlife, Mbalax, and later Afro-rock. This can be heard in the work of seminal acts like K. Frimpong and Monomono.[citation needed] The Farfisa sound is today used to impart a stereotypical 1960s-retro essence to music. It was a key ingredient to the sound of bands such as Inspiral Carpets and has appeared recently on many albums by contemporary artists. The Farfisa brand name, meanwhile, continues to appear on contemporary MIDI keyboards. The Italian keyboardist/artist Joey Mauro used various Farfisas (Syntorchestra, Professional, Compact, Deluxe, and VIP) to create sound in his Italo disco songs. One of Farfisa's most distinctive and expensive organs was the Farfisa Pergamon\u00a0[de], which debuted in 1981. Due to its weight of over 200 kilograms (440\u00a0lb), the Pergamon didn't have a portable version. The Post-rock group Stereolab used various Farfisa organs extensively throughout their career. They were also used by Candida Doyle of the Sheffield group Pulp.  A Farfisa was used on Mike Watt's \"Against the 70's\", played by former Nirvana bassist, Krist Novoselic. The rock group Green Day used a Farfisa organ on the song \"Misery\" from the album Warning, played by their bassist Mike Dirnt.[8] The Compact series had four models. On the Compact Duo dual manual organs, tone and volume were regulated by controls on the F/AR combination preamp, reverb and power supply unit. On most other models the tone controls and a bass section volume were located on an indented panel on the rear of the keyboard. Underneath the keyboards, a knee-high lever could be actuated for the tone boost feature, turned on by rocker levers on the console. All models had reverb except for the mini-compact. Optional feature: 13-note bass pedals (not for the mini-compact).[9] The Mini-Compact is the smallest of the Compact Series. It has only four octaves, with no bass on the early models. The later version had a selector switch to choose bass or acute sound in the lowest octave; these models had grey naturals with white sharps in the bass octave. Some of these extended bass models have only 3 voices, while the later models had 6 voices.[10] The model was used by Mike Mills (R.E.M.), Kate Radley of Spiritualized and by Steve Reich in his piece Four Organs.[citation needed] Features: Features: Features: Most renowned of the Compact Series, having been used by Rick Wright (Pink Floyd), Stereolab, Al Kooper (Blues Project), Michael MacNeil (Simple Minds), Keith Emerson (ELP), and Clint Boon (The Inspiral Carpets).[11] Features: The FAST (Farfisa All Silicon Transistor) Series models had a metal cabinet covered with a washable skin plate and plastic edges, chrome folding legs, retractable carrying handles, and a removable music rack.  This model of Farfisa was used by Philip Glass on some of his early recordings.  This series had the combo organs (FAST 2,3,4,5,Console), and the Professional (Original, Duo, and Pianos) Features: Features: Features, same as FAST 4, plus:  Artists: Notable Artists: Candida Doyle (Pulp), The Ventures (seen on Hawaii Five-O clip), Irmin Schmidt (Can) These are the top of the line models made by Farfisa - In 1972 Leir Siegler and started producing VIP models, and custom models. During this same time period, Farfisa also produced a line of effect pedals: the Repeat/Volume pedal (in orange), the WahWah/Volume pedal (in green), and the Sferasound pedal (in blue).  There was also a high-end amplifier called the 80 or S-80, which came with speaker cabinets, either the Twin-80, or the BR-80. The Farfisa Matador was produced in the early to mid-1970s. It is a compact organ with a built-in speaker and amplifier. Several models of Matador were produced. In the mid-1970s Farfisa produced the \"Stereo Syntorchestra\", with a three octave keyboard, and \"mono\" and \"poli\" tone generator sections. The \"poli\" section has four timbres: Trombone, Trumpet, Piano, and Viola. The mono section is the \"synth\" part of the machine. It has nine timbres: Tuba, Trombone, Trumpet, Bari Sax, Alto Sax, Bass Flute, Flute, Piccolo, and Violin. This section is monophonic, with a highest note priority. The mono section can be modified by two envelope controls and a wah-wah; there is also a variable portamento. Only one timbre from each section can be used at a time. Each section has a brilliance control, which adds more top end to the sound, and a variable speed vibrato, which has a delay function, for delayed vibrato effects.  The Syntorchestra also has separate outputs for each of its two sections. Farfisa also produced two very large organs which incorporated the Syntorchestra at this time, the 259r and 6290r \"Maharani\" organs. Some examples of recordings including the Farfisa Syntorchestra are New Age of Earth by Ashra (Manuel G\u00f6ttsching) and Moondawn by Klaus Schulze (especially the first half of the B-side, \"Mindphaser\"). The Syntorchestra was produced at a similar period in the mid-1970s to the more basic String Orchestra, which included piano and string sections. The Soundmaker was Farfisa's next non-organ instrument, with a further development of the synthesizer approach, incorporating string, brass and monosynth sections. The \"Polychrome\", built at the end of the 1970s, was Farfisa's largest and most well-featured non-organ instrument, as an analog synthesizer featuring vocal, brass, string, and percussion sections, and including a built in chorus,  phaser and modulation as well as aftertouch sensitivity. The \"Transicord\" was a transistor accordion. Essentially, it was not a true accordion; an \"accordion-shaped combo organ\" would have been perhaps a more fitting name. There were no reeds; it was purely electronic. It was designed to be used in conjunction with Farfisa's Amplifiers, and had a multi-pin cable that connected the controls of the accordion, with the controls of the amplifier, or the F/AR Reverb preamp power supply unit. The Transicord came in two models, a \"standard\" and a \"DeLuxe.\" The standard has one row of stop-tabs similar to those found on a Combo Compact organ, and is reported to have a similar sound.  The color scheme was grey with light blue and green. The DeLuxe has two rows of stop-tabs and is black in color. Opening and closing the bellows reportedly engage an effect similar to the \"tone boost\" knee lever on Combo Compact model organs. The Transicord can also be equipped with the same volume pedal used for many other Farfisa organs. Among the very last combo organs made by Farfisa were the Bravo and Commander, produced at the end of the 1970s. The Commander reprised part of the design of the VIP 205 in updated form, while the lightweight and simple Bravo's sound was a move to reflect the changing tastes of the time. ",

            "text": "Fazioli Pianoforti (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[fa\u02c8tsj\u0254\u02d0li]), translated as Fazioli Pianos, produces hand-built grand and concert pianos from their factory in Sacile, Italy. The company was founded by engineer and pianist Paolo Fazioli[1] in 1978.[2] The craftsmen at Fazioli build 140 pianos a year.[3] Paolo Fazioli was born in Rome in 1944, into a family of furniture makers. In 1969 he graduated from Sapienza University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and in 1971 received a diploma in piano at the G. Rossini Conservatory in Pesaro, where he studied under Sergio Cafaro. In the same period he also earned a master's degree in Music Composition at the Academy of St. Cecilia, where he studied with the composer Boris Porena. In the meantime, his elder brothers took over the family business: a factory producing office furniture, using rare and exotic woods such as teak, mahogany and rosewood. Paolo Fazioli joined the company as well, however, he never gave up on pursuing his dream of building the world's finest grand pianos, and at the end of the 1970s, the Fazioli Piano Factory was born within the furniture plant in Sacile, about 40 miles north of Venice. In 1979, Fazioli started designing the first prototype for a baby grand piano. He was assisted by a small team consisting of Professor Pietro Righini, an expert in musical acoustics,[citation needed] and Professor Guglielmo Giordano, a noted wood technologist, as well as Virgilio Fazioli and Lino Tiveron. The prototype of the F183 model was completed in June 1980, followed at the end of the year by the prototypes of two other models, the F156 and the F278. In the latter half of the year, work began on the prototype of the F228 model. In February 1982 all four models were exhibited at the Musikmesse Frankfurt.[citation needed] The production area within the MIM factory was expanded to 600 square metres (6,500\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) increasing production to two pianos per month. In 1983, the company began collaborating with Zeltron (Zanussi Institute for Research) with the aim of further improving tonal quality. Initial success followed in 1984 and 1985 when well-known pianists including Aldo Ciccolini, Alfred Brendel, Martha Argerich, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lazar Berman, Nikita Magaloff, Michel Beroff, Annie Fischer, Louis Lortie and many others began to play on Fazioli pianos. A number of important concert halls purchased the F278 concert grand piano,[citation needed] and the firm started exporting to major European countries and the United States. The demand for an instrument having even greater power and richness of tone, for use in large concert halls, inspired the concept of the F308 model, which is still the longest piano available on the market. Alongside this project, work began on a new model to complement the existing line, the medium-size F212 with a length of 212 cm. In 1998, the company purchased an area of approximately 14,000 square metres (150,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) next to the existing factory, leading to the construction of a new plant capable of producing approximately 150 instruments per year. The new facility includes a laboratory for acoustic research and a concert hall in which new instruments can be tested. In 2001 the new factory edged closer to the target of 100 pianos per year.  In 2004, large orders were placed and production finally exceeded 100 units. That same year, the new offices and the Fazioli Concert Hall were completed. Equipped with variable acoustic devices, the hall is ideal for instrument testing, concerts and recordings alike. The Fazioli Concert Hall's first Concert Season was inaugurated by Aldo Ciccolini, who played the instrument which is still standing in the hall: the F278 concert grand nicknamed \"Merlin the Magician\" by Ciccolini. By 2006, Fazioli was producing between 120 and 130 pianos per year. The prototype of the first F308 received its first public performance in 1987, at the Teatro Comunale in Monfalcone, where French pianist Fran\u00e7ois-Jo\u00ebl Thiollier performed both of Tchaikovsky's piano concertos. Later that year, Lazar Berman played Liszt's Second Concerto on the F308 concert grand at the Carnegie Hall in New York. Murray Perahia also requested the same model for his concert at the Teatro Goldoni in Venice. Toward the end of that year, Alfred Brendel chose to perform on Fazioli pianos for his Italian tour. The cooperation with the Zanussi R&D Centre led to the optimisation of the entire product line: the six improved models (F156, F183, F212, F228, F278, F308), which today still represent the entire Fazioli range, were showcased at the 1988 edition of the Musikmesse Frankfurt. Following the expansion and modernization, output hit six units per month in this period. In 1994, Fazioli Pianoforti attended its first exhibition at the NAMM show in Anaheim, California. In the same year, the company displayed at Music China in Shanghai. A concert grand piano was installed in the Sydney Town Hall in Australia and its debut performance came in a concert attended by Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. Fazioli pianos were also chosen for the Gina Bachauer Piano Competition in Salt Lake City. In 1993, Indonesian pianist Ananda Sukarlan recorded his first CD, The Pentatonic Connection on the first Fazioli piano in Holland. In 1995, the F308 model was unveiled at the NAMM Show. In June, the F308 model was presented in China, leading to the purchase of one of these instruments by the Beijing Conservatory. In 1996, a Fazioli was chosen for concerts in the Vienna Musikverein by Ingeborg Baldaszti, Markus Schirmer, Jasminka Stancul and Elisabeth Leonskaya. The unique Brunei concert grand was built to order for the Sultan of Brunei, featuring inlays of precious stones, mother of pearl and exotic woods. In addition to standard black instruments, the company developed a series of unique art case models to cater to its most exacting customers. In 1997 Fazioli pianos were used for the first time at Umbria Jazz, one of the world's premiere jazz festivals, both for the summer edition in Perugia and the winter companion festival in Orvieto. Through Umbria Jazz, a number of noted jazz artists have since become devotees of Fazioli pianos, including Herbie Hancock, Martial Solal, Brad Mehldau, Chucho Valdez, Michel Camilo, Uri Caine, Kenny Barron, Stefano Bollani, Enrico Pieranunzi, Danilo Rea. The company's relationship with pianist Angela Hewitt became even more productive in 2003, when the artist began requesting Fazioli pianos for her world concert tours. In May Louis Lortie used a Fazioli grand piano to perform a recital in place of Maurizio Pollini at Carnegie Hall in New York, earning glowing reviews.[citation needed] During the same year The Economist reported that \"some artists believe that Fazioli now makes the best pianos in the world\".[citation needed] In September 2003, during a memorial ceremony for the victims of the September 11 attacks in New York City, 21 Fazioli pianos were used for the world premiere of \"Sinfonia per 21 Pianoforti\" by Italian composer and pianist Daniele Lombardi. In June 2010, in a interview with Michael Gallant of Keyboard magazine, Herbie Hancock talks about his Fazioli giving him inspiration to do things.[4] Fazioli pianos are used at many piano competitions, including the Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw (2010, 2015), the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow (2011, 2015) and the Rubinstein Piano Master Competition in Tel Aviv (May 2014), where five out of the six finalists chose the Fazioli piano for their concerto performance.[citation needed] The Juilliard School, New York, bought a Fazioli grand piano in 2015. Fazioli offers six models of grand pianos, the largest being the Fazioli F308 which, with its 3.08 m (10\u00a0ft 2 in), is the longest piano available on the general market. The Fazioli F308 has the \"fourth pedal\", which brings the hammers closer to the strings, thus reducing sound volume without changing the tone,[5] functioning just like the soft pedal on an upright piano.[citation needed] Camerata Tokyo released a Blu-ray named The Sound of the Concert Grand Fazioli F278: Costantino Catena plays Debussy and Schumann (Camerata Tokyo 2013, CMBD-80005).[6] ",

Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939 out of Alfa Romeo's race division as Auto Avio Costruzioni, the company built its first car in 1940. However, the company's inception as an auto manufacturer is usually recognized in 1947, when the first Ferrari-badged car was completed. In 2014 Ferrari was rated the world's most powerful brand by Brand Finance.[3] In June 2018, the 1964 250 GTO became the most expensive car in history, setting an all-time record selling price of $70 million.[4][5] Fiat S.p.A. acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 90% in 1988.[6] In October 2014 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCA) announced its intentions to separate Ferrari S.p.A.  from FCA; as of the announcement FCA owned 90% of Ferrari.[7][8][9] The separation began in October 2015 with a restructuring that established Ferrari N.V. (a company incorporated in the Netherlands) as the new holding company of the Ferrari group and the subsequent sale by FCA of 10% of the shares in an IPO and concurrent listing of common shares on the New York Stock Exchange.[10] Through the remaining steps of the separation, FCA's interest in Ferrari's business was distributed to shareholders of FCA, with 10% continuing to be owned by Piero Ferrari.[11] The spin-off was completed on 3 January 2016.[10] Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it is the oldest and most successful racing team, holding the most constructors championships (16) and having produced the highest number of drivers' championship wins (15).[12] Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.[13] Enzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929, with headquarters in Modena. Scuderia Ferrari (pronounced [skude\u02c8ri\u02d0a]) literally means \"Ferrari Stable\" and is usually used to mean \"Team Ferrari.\" Ferrari bought,[citation needed] prepared, and fielded Alfa Romeo racing cars for gentleman drivers, functioning as the racing division of Alfa Romeo. In 1933, Alfa Romeo withdrew its in-house racing team and Scuderia Ferrari took over as its works team:[2] the Scuderia received Alfa's Grand Prix cars of the latest specifications and fielded many famous drivers such as Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi. In 1938, Alfa Romeo brought its racing operation again in-house, forming Alfa Corse in Milan and hired Enzo Ferrari as manager of the new racing department; therefore the Scuderia Ferrari was disbanded.[2] In September 1939, Ferrari left Alfa Romeo under the provision he would not use the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for at least four years.[2] A few days later he founded Auto Avio Costruzioni, headquartered in the facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari.[2] The new company ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. In 1940, Ferrari produced a race car \u2013 the Tipo 815, based on a Fiat platform. It was the first Ferrari car and debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia, but due to World War II it saw little competition. In 1943, the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. The factory was bombed by the Allies and subsequently rebuilt including works for road car production. The first Ferrari-badged car was the 1947 125 S, powered by a 1.5\u00a0L V12 engine;[2] Enzo Ferrari reluctantly built and sold his automobiles to fund Scuderia Ferrari.[14] The Scuderia Ferrari name was resurrected to denote the factory racing cars and distinguish them from those fielded by customer teams. In 1960 the company was restructured as a public corporation under the name SEFAC S.p.A. (Societ\u00e0 Esercizio Fabbriche Automobili e Corse).[15] Early in 1969, Fiat took a 50% stake in Ferrari. An immediate result was an increase in available investment funds, and work started at once on a factory extension intended to transfer production from Fiat's Turin plant of the Ferrari engined Fiat Dino. New model investment further up in the Ferrari range also received a boost. In 1988, Enzo Ferrari oversaw the launch of the Ferrari F40, the last new Ferrari launched before his death later that year. In 1989, the company was renamed Ferrari S.p.A.[15] From 2002 to 2004, Ferrari produced the Enzo, their fastest model at the time, which was introduced and named in honor of the company's founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was to be called the F60, continuing on from the F40 and F50, but Ferrari was so pleased with it, they called it the Enzo instead. It was initially offered to loyal and recurring customers, each of the 399 made (minus the 400th which was donated to the Vatican for charity) had a price tag of $650,000 apiece (equivalent to \u00a3400,900). On 15 September 2012, 964 Ferrari cars worth over $162 million (\u00a399.95 million) attended the Ferrari Driving Days event at Silverstone Circuit and paraded round the Silverstone Circuit setting a world record.[16] Ferrari's former CEO and Chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, resigned from the company after 23 years, who was succeeded by Amedeo Felisa and finally on 3 May 2016 Amedeo resigned and was succeeded by Sergio Marchionne, CEO and Chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Ferrari's parent company.[17] In July 2018, Marchionne was replaced by board member Louis Camilleri as CEO and by John Elkann as chairman.[18] On 29 October 2014, the FCA group, resulting from the merger between manufacturers Fiat and Chrysler, announced the split of its luxury brand, Ferrari. The aim is to turn Ferrari into an independent brand which 10% of stake will be sold in an IPO in 2015.[19]  Ferrari officially priced its initial public offering at $52 a share after the market close on 20 October 2015.[20] Since the company's beginnings, Ferrari has been involved in motorsport, competing in a range of categories including Formula One and sports car racing through its Scuderia Ferrari sporting division as well as supplying cars and engines to other teams and for one make race series. The 1940 AAC 815 was the first racing car to be designed by Enzo Ferrari, although it was not badged as a Ferrari model. Scuderia Ferrari has participated in several classes of motorsport, though it is currently only officially involved in Formula One. It is the only team to have competed in the Formula One World Championship continuously since its inception in 1950. Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez gave the team its first F1 victory at the 1951 British Grand Prix. Alberto Ascari gave Ferrari its first Drivers Championship a year later. Ferrari is the oldest team in the championship, and the most successful: the team holds nearly every Formula One record. As of 2014[update], the team's records include 15 World Drivers Championship titles, 16 World Constructors Championship titles, 221 Grand Prix victories, 6736.27 points, 679 podium finishes, 207 pole positions, and 230 fastest laps in 890 Grands Prix contested. Of the 19 tracks used in 2014, 8 have lap records set by the F2004, with a further 3 set by the F2003-GA, F2008 and F10. Ferrari drivers include: Tazio Nuvolari, Jos\u00e9 Froil\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Luigi Chinetti, Maurice Trintignant, Wolfgang von Trips, Phil Hill, Olivier Gendebien, Mike Hawthorn, Peter Collins, Giancarlo Baghetti, Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, Chris Amon, John Surtees, Lorenzo Bandini, Ludovico Scarfiotti, Jacky Ickx, Mario Andretti, Clay Regazzoni, Niki Lauda, Carlos Reutemann, Jody Scheckter, Gilles Villeneuve, Didier Pironi, Patrick Tambay, Ren\u00e9 Arnoux, Michele Alboreto, Gerhard Berger, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Jean Alesi, Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine, Rubens Barrichello, Felipe Massa, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, and Charles Leclerc. At the end of the 2006 season, the team courted controversy by continuing to allow Marlboro to sponsor them after they, along with the other F1 teams, made a promise to end sponsorship deals with tobacco manufacturers. A five-year deal was agreed and although this was not due to end until 2011, in April 2008 Marlboro dropped their on-car branding on Ferrari. In addition to Formula One, Ferrari also entered cars in sportscar racing, the two programs existing in parallel for many years. In 1949, Luigi Chinetti drove a 166 M to Ferrari's first win in motorsports, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Ferrari went on to dominate the early years of the World Sportscar Championship which was created in 1953, winning the title seven out of its first nine years. When the championship format changed in 1962, Ferrari earned titles in at least one class each year through to 1965 and then again in 1967.  Ferrari would win one final title, the 1972 World Championship of Makes before Enzo decided to leave sports car racing after 1973 and allow Scuderia Ferrari to concentrate solely on Formula One. During Ferrari's seasons of the World Sportscars Championship, they also gained more wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with the factory team earning their first in 1954.  Another win would come in 1958, followed by five consecutive wins from 1960 to 1964. Luigi Chinetti's North American Racing Team (NART) would take Ferrari's final victory at Le Mans in 1965. Although Scuderia Ferrari no longer participated in sports cars after 1973, they have occasionally built various successful sports cars for privateers.  These include the BB 512 LM in the 1970s, the 333 SP which won the IMSA GT Championship in the 1990s, and currently the 458 GT2 and GT3 which are currently winning championships in their respective classes. Throughout its history, Ferrari has supplied racing cars to other entrants, aside from its own works Scuderia Ferrari team. In the 1950s and '60s, Ferrari supplied Formula One cars to a number of private entrants and other teams. One famous example was Tony Vandervell's team, which raced the Thinwall Special modified Ferraris before building their own Vanwall cars. The North American Racing Team's entries in the final three rounds of the 1969 season were the last occasions on which a team other than Scuderia Ferrari entered a World Championship Grand Prix with a Ferrari car.[21] Ferrari supplied cars complete with V8 engines for the A1 Grand Prix series, from the 2008-09 season.[22] The car was designed by Rory Byrne and is styled to resemble the 2004 Ferrari Formula one car. Ferrari currently runs a customer GT program for a racing version of its 458 and has done so for the 458's predecessors, dating back to the 355 in the late 1990s. Such private teams as the American Risi Competizione and Italian AF Corse teams have been very successful with Ferrari GT racers over the years. This car, made for endurance sportscar racing to be competed against such racing versions of the Audi R8, McLaren MP4-12C, and BMW Z4 (E89) has proven to be successful, but not as successful as its predecessor, the F430. The Ferrari Challenge is a one-make racing series for the Ferrari 458. The FXX is not road legal and is therefore only used for track events. The first vehicle made with the Ferrari name was the 125 S.  This was primarily a sports/racing model. In 1949, the 166 Inter was introduced marking the company's significant move into the grand touring road car market.  Road cars continue to make up the bulk of Ferrari sales to the present day. Many early cars featured bodywork designed and customised by independent coachbuilders such as Pininfarina, Scaglietti, Zagato, Vignale and Bertone.  Starting in the early 2010s with the LaFerrari, the focus was shifted to what is now the standard, Ferrari relying on an in-house design from the Centro Stile Ferrari. The original road cars were typically two seat front engined V12s.  This platform served Ferrari very well through the 1950s and 1960s.  In 1968 the Dino was introduced as the first two-seat rear mid-engined Ferrari.  The Dino was produced primarily with a V6 engine, however, a V8 model was also developed. This rear mid-engine layout would go on to be used in many Ferraris of the 1980s, 1990s and to the present day.  Current road cars typically use V8 or V12 engines, with V8 models making up well over half of the marque's total production.  Historically, Ferrari has also produced flat 12 engines. For a time, Ferrari built 2+2 versions of its mid-engined V8 cars. Although they looked quite different from their 2-seat counterparts, both the GT4 and Mondial were closely related to the 308 GTB.[citation needed] The company has also produced several front-engined 2+2 cars, culminating in the current V12 model Lusso and V8 models Portofino and Lusso T.  The California is credited with initiating the popular current model line of V8 front-engined 2+2 grand touring performance sports cars.[citation needed] Ferrari entered the mid-engined 12-cylinder fray with the Berlinetta Boxer in 1973.  The later Testarossa (also mid-engined 12 cylinder) remains one of the most popular and famous Ferrari road cars of all time. In the 1950s and 1960s, clients often personalized their vehicles as they came straight from the factory.[23]  This philosophy added to the mystique of the brand.  Every Ferrari that comes out of Maranello is built to an individual customer's specification.  In this sense, each vehicle is a unique result of a specific client's desire. Ferrari formalized this concept with its earlier Carrozzeria Scaglietti programme.  The options offered here were more typical such as racing seats, rearview cameras, and other special trim.  In late 2011, Ferrari announced a significant update of this philosophy.  The Tailor Made programme allows clients to work with designers in Maranello to make decisions at every step of the process.  Through this program almost any trim, any exterior color or any interior material are possible. The program carries on the original tradition and emphasizes the idea of each car being unique.[23] The 1984 288 GTO may be considered the first in the line of Ferrari supercars.  This pedigree extends through the Enzo Ferrari to the LaFerrari. In March 2018, at the 88th Geneva International Motor Show, Ferrari revealed its latest supercar, the 488 Pista.[24] Ferrari SF90 Stradale is the first ever Ferrari to feature PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) architecture which sees the internal combustion engine integrated with three electric motors, two of which are independent and located on the front axle, with the third at the rear between the engine and the gearbox.[25] Ferrari has produced a number of concept cars, such as the Mythos. While some of these were quite radical (such as the Modulo) and never intended for production, others such as the Mythos have shown styling elements which were later incorporated into production models. The most recent concept car to be produced by Ferrari themselves was the 2010 Millechili. A number of one-off special versions of Ferrari road cars have also been produced, commissioned to coachbuilders by wealthy owners. Recent examples include the P4/5[26] and the 412 Kappa. The Special Projects programme was launched in the late 2000s as Ferrari's ultimate in-house personalization service, enabling customers to own bespoke bodied one-offs based on modern Ferrari road cars.[27] Engineering and design is done by Ferrari, sometimes in cooperation with external design houses like Pininfarina or Fioravanti, and the vehicles receive full homologation to be road legal.[27] The first car to be completed under this programme was the 2008 SP1, commissioned by a Japanese business executive, the second was the P540 Superfast Aperta, commissioned by an American collector.[27] The following is a list of Special Projects cars that have been made public: An F430 Spider that runs on ethanol was displayed at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Ferrari unveiled a hybrid version of their flagship 599. Called the \"HY-KERS Concept\", Ferrari's hybrid system adds more than 100 horsepower on top of the 599 Fiorano's 612\u00a0HP.[42] Also in mid-2014, the flagship LaFerrari was put into production. From the beginning, the Ferrari naming convention consisted of a three-digit unitary displacement of an engine cylinder with an additional suffix representing the purpose of a vehicle. Therefore, Ferrari 125 S had 1.5\u00a0L (1496.77 cc) V12 engine with unitary displacement of 124.73 cc; whilst S-suffix represented Sport. Other race cars also received names invoking particular races like Ferrari 166 MM for Mille Miglia. With introduction of road-going models, suffix Inter was added, inspired by Scuderia Inter racing team of Igor Troubetzkoy. Popular at that time 166-series had 2.0\u00a0L (1995.02 cc) engines with 166.25 cc of unitary displacement and a very diverse 250-series had 3.0 L (2953.21 cc) of total displacement and 246.10 cc of unitary. Later series of road cars were renamed Europa and top of the line series: America and Superamerica. Until the early 1990s, Ferrari followed a three-number naming scheme based on engine displacement and number of cylinders: Most Ferraris were also given designations referring to their body style. In general, the following conventions were used: This naming system can be confusing, as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style. Many Ferraris also had other names affixed (like Daytona) to identify them further. Many such names are actually not official factory names. The Daytona name commemorates Ferrari's triple success in the February 1967 24 Hours of Daytona with the 330 P4.[43] Only in the 1973 Daytona 24 Hours, a 365 GTB/4 run by NART (who raced Ferraris in America) ran second, behind a Porsche 911.[44] The various Dino models were named for Enzo's son, Dino Ferrari, and were marketed as Dinos by Ferrari and sold at Ferrari dealers\u2014for all intents and purposes they are Ferraris. In the mid-1990s, Ferrari added the letter \"F\" to the beginning of all models (a practice abandoned after the F512 M and F355, but adopted again with the F430, but not with its successor, the Ferrari 458 ). The famous symbol of the Ferrari race team is the Cavallino Rampante (\"prancing horse\") black prancing stallion on a yellow shield, usually with the letters S F (for Scuderia Ferrari), with three stripes of green, white and red (the Italian national colors) at the top. The road cars have a rectangular badge on the hood (see picture at top of page), and, optionally, the shield-shaped race logo on the sides of both front wings, close to the door. On 17 June 1923, Enzo Ferrari won a race at the Savio track in Ravenna where he met the Countess Paolina, mother of Count Francesco Baracca, an ace of the Italian air force and national hero of World War I, who used to paint a horse on the side of his planes. The Countess asked Enzo to use this horse on his cars, suggesting that it would bring him good luck. The original \"prancing horse\" on Baracca's airplane was painted in red on a white cloud-like shape, but Ferrari chose to have the horse in black (as it had been painted as a sign of grief on Baracca's squadron planes after the pilot was killed in action) and he added a canary yellow background as this is the color of the city of Modena, his birthplace. The Ferrari horse was, from the very beginning, markedly different from the Baracca horse in most details, the most noticeable being the tail that in the original Baracca version was pointing downward. Ferrari has used the cavallino rampante on official company stationery since 1929. Since the Spa 24 Hours of 9 July 1932, the cavallino rampante has been used on Alfa Romeos raced by Scuderia Ferrari. The motif of a prancing horse is old, it can be found on ancient coins. A similar black horse on a yellow shield is the Coat of Arms of the German city of Stuttgart, home of Mercedes-Benz and the design bureau of Porsche, both being main competitors of Alfa and Ferrari in the 1930s. The city's name derives from Stutengarten, an ancient form of the German word Gest\u00fct, which translates into English as stud farm and into Italian as scuderia. Porsche also includes the Stuttgart sign in its corporate logo, centred in the emblem of the state of W\u00fcrttemberg. Stuttgart's R\u00f6ssle has both rear legs firmly planted on the soil, like Baracca's horse, but unlike Ferrari's cavallino. Fabio Taglioni used the cavallino rampante on his Ducati motorbikes, as Taglioni was born at Lugo di Romagna like Baracca, and his father too was a military pilot during WWI (although not part of Baracca's squadron, as is sometimes mistakenly reported). As Ferrari's fame grew, Ducati abandoned the horse- perhaps the result of a private agreement between the two companies. The cavallino rampante is the visual symbol of Ferrari. Cavallino Magazine uses the name, but not the logo. Other companies use similar logos: Avanti, an Austrian company operating over 100 filling stations, uses a prancing horse logo which is nearly identical to Ferrari's, as does Iron Horse Bicycles and Norfolk Southern Railway. Since the 1920s, Italian race cars of Alfa Romeo, Maserati and later Ferrari and Abarth were (and often still are) painted in \"race red\" (Rosso Corsa). This was the customary national racing color of Italy, as recommended between the World Wars by the organizations that later would become the FIA. It refers to the nationality of the competing team, not that of the car manufacturer or driver. In that scheme, French-entered cars such as Bugatti were blue, German such as Auto Union and Mercedes white (since 1934 also bare sheet metal silver), and British green such as the mid-1960s Lotus and BRM, for instance. Ferrari won the 1964 World championship with John Surtees by competing the last two races in North America with cars painted in the US-American race colors white and blue, as these were not entered by the Italian factory themselves, but by the U.S.-based North American Racing Team (NART) team. This was done as a protest concerning arguments between Ferrari and the Italian Racing Authorities regarding the homologation of a new mid-engined Ferrari race car. In 1963, Enzo Ferrari was approached by the Ford Motor Company about a possible buy out.[45] Ford audited Ferrari's assets but legal negotiations and talks were unilaterally cut off by Ferrari when he realized that the deal offered by Ford would not enable him to stay at the helm of the company racing program. Henry Ford II consequently directed his racing division to negotiate with Lotus, Lola, and Cooper to build a car capable of beating Ferrari on the world endurance circuit, eventually resulting in the production of the Ford GT40 in 1964. As the Ford deal fell through, FIAT approached Ferrari with a more flexible proposal and purchased controlling interests in the company in 1969. Enzo Ferrari retained a 10% share, which is currently owned by his son Piero Lardi Ferrari. Ferrari has an internally managed merchandising line that licenses many products bearing the Ferrari brand, including eyewear, pens, pencils, electronic goods, perfume, cologne, clothing, high-tech bicycles, watches, cell phones and laptop computers. Ferrari also runs a museum, the Museo Ferrari in Maranello, which displays road and race cars and other items from the company's history. In 1997 Ferrari launched a long term master planned effort to improve overall corporate efficiency, production and employee happiness.  The program was called Formula Uomo and became a case study in social sustainability.[46]  It took over ten years to fully implement and included over \u20ac200 million (2008) in investment.[47] Ferrari has had a long-standing relationship with Shell Oil. It is a technical partnership with Ferrari and Ducati to test as well as supply fuel and oils to the Formula One, MotoGP and World Superbike racing teams. For example, the Shell V-Power premium gasoline fuel has been developed with the many years of technical expertise between Shell and Ferrari.[48] Ferrari has had agreements to supply Formula One engines to a number of other teams over the years, and currently supply Sauber F1 Team, and Haas F1 Team. As of the end of 2018, the total of Ferrari built and sold cars in their whole company history is 208,931.[49] Approximately thirty Ferrari boutiques exist worldwide, with two owned by Ferrari and the rest operating as franchises.  The stores sell branded clothes, accessories and racing memorabilia. Clothing includes upscale and lower-priced collections for men, women, and children. Some stores include race car simulation games for entertainment.[78] Coordinates: 44\u00b031\u203257\u2033N 10\u00b051\u203251\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff44.532447\u00b0N 10.864137\u00b0E\ufeff / 44.532447; 10.864137 ",

His son Pietro (the founder's grandson), who oversaw global business, died on April 18, 2011, in a cycling accident in South Africa at the age of 47. The Ferrero Group worldwide \u2013 now headed by CEO Giovanni Ferrero \u2013 includes 38 trading companies, 18 factories, approximately 40,000 employees and produces around 365,000 tonnes[3] of Nutella each year. Ferrero International SA's headquarters is in Luxembourg.  Ferrero SpA is a private company owned by the Ferrero family and has been described as \"one of the world's most secretive firms\".[4] Reputation Institute's 2009 survey ranks Ferrero as the most reputable company in the world.[5] The company's financial results for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2016 showed consolidated sales growth of 8.2% from the previous fiscal year.[6] In 1946, Pietro Ferrero invented a cream of hazelnuts and cocoa, derived from gianduja and called it Pasta Gianduja. The initial product came in solid loaves wrapped in aluminium foil, which had to be sliced with a knife, and was succeeded by a spreadable version Supercrema.[7] With assistance from his brother Giovanni Ferrero, Pietro Ferrero created his new company to produce and market the initial product.[8] Following his work, Pietro was succeeded by his son Michele Ferrero as chief executive. Michele and his wife Maria Franca relaunched his father's recipe as Nutella, which was first sold in 1964. After World War II, they opened production sites and offices abroad[8] and Nutella eventually became the world's leading chocolate-nut spread brand.[7] Ferrero is the world's largest consumer of hazelnuts, buying up 25% of global production in 2014.[7] The company is currently run by Giovanni Ferrero, grandson of Pietro and son to Michele Ferrero.[8] The company places great emphasis on secrecy, reportedly to guard against industrial espionage.[4] It has never held a press conference and does not allow media visits to its plants. Ferrero's products are made with machines designed by an in-house engineering department.[4] In 2014, Ferrero acquired Oltan Group, the largest hazelnut supplier in the world.[9] Ferrero acquired the British chocolate retailer Thorntons in June 2015 for \u00a3112 million.[10][11]  In 2016, Ferrero SpA acquired Belgian biscuit brands Delacre and DeliChoc from United Biscuits.[12] In March 2017, Ferrero SpA bought the chocolate maker Fannie May from 1-800-Flowers.com. The deal closed on May 30, 2017 and Ferrero paid $115 million. Ferrero mentioned that they hope to expand Fannie May as a whole. They want to provide Fannie May locations across the nation, not just in Chicago.[13][14][15] On 30 March 2017, it was announced that Lapo Civiletti will be the first non-family CEO in the history of the company and will take up the role from 1 September, while Giovanni Ferrero will become the executive chairman focusing on long-term strategy.[16] In October 2017, Ferrero announced to acquire the Ferrara Candy Company,[17] and the acquisition was completed in December that year.[18] On 16 January 2018, it was reported that Ferrero was purchasing Nestl\u00e9's American confectionery business for $2.8 billion. The deal includes such brands as Baby Ruth, Crunch Bar and Butterfinger but does not affect Nestl\u00e9's confectionery business elsewhere, and does not include Kit Kat or the Toll House baking line.[19] The acquisition was completed in March 2018.[20][21] On 1 April 2019, it was announced that Ferrero will further expand its US business to purchase a collection of business owned by Kellogg's. Included in the deal will be Kelloggs' cookies, fruit and fruit-flavoured snack, ice cream cone and pie crust businesses and will involve famous brands such as Famous Amos, Murray's, Keebler, Mother's and Little Brownie Bakers (one of the producers of the cookies for the Girl Scouts of the USA), \"as well as a leased manufacturing facility in Baltimore, Maryland\"; \"six owned food manufacturing facilities\" in Louisville and Florence, Kentucky; Augusta, Georgia; Allyn, Washington and \"two plants in Chicago, Illinois\". Ferrero is paying Kellogg's $1.3 billion for the deal.[22][23] On 29 July 2019 the acquisition was completed.[24] In July 2019, a subsidiary of Ferrero agreed to buy Campbell Soup Company's stake in the danish bakery, Kelsen Group for $ 300 million. The transfer will be completed sometime early 2020.[25] Ferrero produces several lines of confectionery goods under various brand names, as well as the chocolate-hazelnut spread, Nutella (since 1964).[26] The production of Nutella uses one-quarter of the world's annual hazelnut supply.[27] It also produces the line of Ferrero branded chocolate products, including Pocket Coffee,[28] Mon Ch\u00e9ri,[28] Confetteria Raffaello,[28] Ferrero K\u00fcsschen[29] and the Ferrero Prestige line, which comprises three different brands of pralines: Ferrero Rocher, Ferrero Rondnoir, and Garden Coco.[30] Ferrero's Kinder brand line of chocolate products include Kinder Surprise,[31] Kinder Joy,[32] Kinder Chocolate,[33] Kinder Happy Hippo,[34] Kinder Maxi,[33] Kinder Duplo,[35] Kinder Country,[36] Kinder D\u00e9lice,[37] and Kinder Bueno.[38][39] The company also produces Tic Tac candy,[32] available in mint,[40] cinnamon, and fruit flavors,[41][42] along with sugar free versions.[43] Other Ferrero products include Giotto,[28] Fiesta Ferrero,[44] Hanuta chocolate hazelnut-filled wafers[45] and Gran Soleil frozen desserts,[46] which won the company an innovation award in March 2011.[47] Ferrero has been producing Thorntons products since acquiring the company in 2015.[10][11] In 1983, the company established the Ferrero Foundation in Alba, Piedmont at the wish of Michele Ferrero. The foundation promotes activities in the areas of art, science, history and literature by organizing conventions, conferences, seminars and exhibitions. It also offers health and social assistance to ex-employees of the group for at least 25 years.[48] ",

(trading as Ferretti Group) is an Italian multinational shipbuilding company headquartered in Forl\u00ec which specialises in the design, construction and sale of luxury motor yachts. Its products are sold under the brands Ferretti Yachts, Custom Line, Pershing, Itama, Riva, Mochi Craft and CRN. Ferretti was founded in 1968 by Alessandro and Norberto Ferretti as a manufacturer of small boats and produced its first motor sailer in 1971. Ferretti expanded through making numerous acquisitions, including of Cantieri Navali dell\u2019Adriatico \u2013 CNA S.r.l. in 1998, CRN S.p.A., in 1999, Riva S.p.A in 2000, Cantiere Navale Mario Morini and in 2002, Itama in 2004 and Allied Marine in 2008. Ferretti was acquired by the Chinese multinational heavy machinery and automotive manufacturing company Weichai Group in 2012. Ferretti has manufacturing operations in Italy and the United States. It has subsidiary companies in the United States (Ferretti Group North America), Brazil (Ferretti Group Brazil, based in S\u00e3o Paulo,and soon one based in Foz do Igua\u00e7u ) and representative branches in Hong Kong and Shanghai (Ferretti Group Asia Pacific). The company was founded in 1968 by Alessandro and Norberto Ferretti and produced its first motor sailer in 1971. During the 1980s, the two brothers decided to specialize in the production of luxury motoryachts. They established a new unit in Forl\u00ec, which today houses the company headquarters. In the early 1990s, Ferretti started an internationalisation process. In 1993, Ferretti of America, Inc. was founded to market motoryachts in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and the Caribbean. Ferretti of America liaised with the sales network that was already present in Greece, France, Spain, Germany and Great Britain, increasing the impact of Ferretti sales abroad. In 1994, Ferretti began an international marketing process by creating a strategic network of dealers outside Europe. During the second half of the 1990s, after institutional investors acquired a share in the capital, an expansion strategy for external lines was started through the acquisition of companies producing luxury motoryachts. In 1996, Ferretti began operating in the segment of yachts with fibreglass flybridges, measuring 28 to 40 metres in length, through Custom Line S.p.A. In 1998, the group purchased Cantieri Navali dell\u2019Adriatico \u2013 CNA S.r.l., which specialized in building open type motor boats with the prestigious Pershing brand. During the same year, Ferretti entered in the sport fisherman craft segment with the acquisition of American company Bertram Yacht, Inc.[1] - the Miami shipyard. Bertram Yacht was sold in 2015. In 1999 Ferretti Group purchased CRN S.p.A., a shipyard specialising in the production of maxiyachts in fibreglass and megayachts with steel hulls and aluminium superstructures, measuring over 30 metres in length. In the year 2000, Ferretti purchased 100% of the capital of Riva S.p.A., a producer of luxury fibreglass yachts measuring 10 to 35 metres in length, both flybridge and open. In June 2000, with the aim of further consolidating its growth and development process, Ferretti Group decided to list on the Official Italian Stock Exchange (MTA). In 2001, the company was admitted to the STAR segment (High Requisite Share Segment) of the Borsa Italiana (Italian Stock Exchange). In May 2001, Ferretti acquired the assets of the Oram shipyard in La Spezia, where the new Riva production area would subsequently be built. In August 2001, Ferretti finalized an agreement for the acquisition of the Apreamare S.p.A. shipyards in Sorrento, a leader in the production of gozzo sorrentino boats measuring 7 to 16 metres in length. In November 2001, acquisition of the Mochi Craft S.r.l. shipyard in Pesaro was finalized. In 2002, the Group took over Diesse Arredamenti, in order to acquire new skills in the nautical furnishings sector, complementary to its yacht building activity. In 2002 the Group also finalized acquisition of Cantiere Navale Mario Morini in Ancona, which enabled CRN to extend its production capacity, Pinmar S.L., a company specialized in yacht painting and refitting, and Zago S.p.A., an Italian company operating in high-profile wooden manufactured pieces and furnishings. Between June 2002 and January 2003, the Ferretti management team and institutional investors present among the shareholders (Permira), decided to launch a Voluntary Public Tender Offer to acquire the entire share capital of the Company, with the aim of further expanding the Group through acquisitions and a precise strategic, national and international plan. In 2004, through Pershing, Ferretti Group acquired the Itama shipyard, which specializes in the construction of open motoryachts, completing the current definition of the Group. In 2008 Ferretti Group acquired the assets, brands and activities of Allied Marine, an American company specialized in After Sales services and marketing of both new and pre-owned motor yachts, as well as brokerage services on the US market. In 2009 in order to align its organisational structure to the new market scenario, Ferretti Group changed its structure and undertook a series of strategic and operative actions. The Group's equity was divided between Norberto Ferretti and the management (38.2%), Mediobanca (8.8%), and senior and mezzanine lenders (the latter with a total 53% in exit participation rights). Norberto Ferretti, the Group's management and Mediobanca held 100% of the Group's voting rights. In December 2009, with the aim of continuing to focus on its core business, the Ferretti Group sold its 60% holding in Pinmar S.L., a Spanish company specializing in painting mega-yachts to Irish entrepreneur Sean Ewing. In March 2010, Ferretti continued its divestment policy by selling 100% of Apreamare S.p.A., which included the nautical pole of Torre Annunziata (Naples), to the Aprea and Pollia families, the founders of the historic Sorrento brand. In 2010 Ferretti Group Brasil was established. Finally, in 2012 Ferretti was acquired by the Chinese multinational heavy machinery and automotive manufacturing company Weichai Group. The group consists of the following design and production companies: Ferretti Group has production facilities in: Ancona, Forl\u00ec, Cattolica, Mondolfo, La Spezia and Sarnico, Italy. In 2010 Ferretti Group had a turnover of approximately 500 million euro  and EBITDA of around 30 million euro. The improvement of this result, in a market still characterized by price pressure, was primarily due to the key initiatives taken by the Ferretti Group during the course of the 2009-2010 nautical year, which resulted in a cost reduction of around 50 million euro. As of August, 31st, 2010, the Group's Net Financial Debt improved compared with the previous year and was reduced to around 590 million euro, basically in line with the Plan. In 1995, after the sudden death of Alessandro Ferretti, 70% of the group was acquired by Permira.[2] In 2000, it was temporarily listed in the Italian Stock Exchange, but decided to be taken private citing concerns for negative financial climate by the September 11, 2001 attacks.[3] Permira had a 54 times return of its original investment from the listing.[4] In October 2006 the owners reconsidered flotation and filed an application to list its shares on the Milan stock exchange. Due to a high level of interest from private equity buyers, the IPO was postponed. Candover bought 60% of the company in an auction, outbidding the French PAI Partners and leaving the rest 30% to the founder and 10% to Permira. Based on financial data, the group was valued at 1.7 billion euros. In May 2008, when the full extend of the crisis had not yet hit, rumours circulated indicating Candover was eyeing a second IPO [5] for the business which was seeing profits of EUR 158m on a EUR 933m turnover (2007). In September, the Consob granted the authorization [6] for the IPO on both the London and Milan bourses. However, in January 2009 the company appointed Rothschild to advise on talks with its banking syndicate, led by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Mediobanca to restructure a EUR 1.1bn debt. Initially Candover was expected to participate in a EUR 100m capital injection but by February, it had walked away from the table, writing off its investment;[7] Permira had already done so. Since then the company has succeeded in renegotiating its debt, reducing its to EUR 550m against a conversion of credits into exit participation rights, a EUR 85m capital injection underwritten by the founder and CEO, Norberto Ferretti and some of the management team (EUR 70m) and Mediobanca (EUR 15m). RBS has also agreed to grantmedium terms facilities to fund working capital requirements (EUR 65m) and three major financial institutions (already partnering with Ferretti), have extended the short-term facilities (EUR 24m) to medium-term ones. The Group's equity is now held by Norberto Ferretti and the Group's management (38.2%), Mediobanca (8.8%) and senior and mezzanine lenders (for a total of 53% in exit participation rights). In particular, as a result of the agreement, Norberto Ferretti, the Group's management and Mediobanca hold 100% of the Group's voting rights.[8] Motivated by the needs for high tech synergy and greater international recognition, the company entered in 1989, into offshore racing. Norberto Ferretti won the Class 1 Offshore World Championship title in 1994.[9] The Ferretti team win the European Offshore Championship in 1995. In 1997 it won both European and World champion titles. The company attributes these winnings to a hi-tech hull designed with a carbon-fiber autoclave.[9] Together with Mitsubishi the Ferretti group has developed a system called ARG (anti-rolling gyro), which reduces the effects of the waves on their boats, using a counterweight and a gyroscope.[10] Notable Ferretti customers have included Richard Burton, Brigitte Bardot[2] and Sophia Loren.

(UK: /\u02c8fi\u02d0\u0259t, -\u00e6t/, US: /-\u0251\u02d0t/; originally FIAT, Italian: Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, lit.\u00a0'Italian Automobiles Factory, Turin') is an Italian automobile manufacturer, a subsidiary of FCA Italy S.p.A., which is part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (previously Fiat S.p.A.). Fiat Automobiles was formed in January 2007 when Fiat reorganized its automobile business,[2] and traces its history back to 1899 when the first Fiat automobile, the Fiat 4 HP, was produced. Fiat Automobiles is the largest automobile manufacturer in Italy. During its more than century-long history, it remained the largest automobile manufacturer in Europe and the third in the world after General Motors and Ford for over 20 years, until the car industry crisis in the late 1980s.[3] In 2013, Fiat S.p.A. was the second largest European automaker by volumes produced and the seventh in the world, while currently FCA is the world's eighth-largest auto maker. In 1970, Fiat Automobiles employed more than 100,000 in Italy when its production reached the highest number, 1.4\u00a0million cars, in that country.[4] As of 2002, it built more than 1 million vehicles at six plants in Italy and the country accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue.[4] Fiat has also manufactured railway engines, military vehicles, farm tractors, aircraft, and weapons such as the Fiat\u2013Revelli Modello 1914. Fiat-brand cars are built in several locations around the world. Outside Italy, the largest country of production is Brazil, where the Fiat brand is the market leader.[5][6] The group also has factories in Argentina, Poland and Mexico (where Fiat-brand vehicles are manufactured at plants owned and operated by FCA US for export to the United States, Brazil, Italy and other markets) and a long history of licensing manufacture of its products in other countries. Fiat Automobiles has received many international awards for its vehicles, including nine European Car of the Year awards, the most of any other manufacturer, and it ranked many times as the lowest level of CO2 emissions by vehicles sold in Europe.[7] On 11 July 1899, Giovanni Agnelli was part of the group of founding members of FIAT, Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino. The first Fiat plant opened in 1900[8] with 35 staff making 24 cars. Known from the beginning for the talent and creativity of its engineering staff, by 1903 Fiat made a small profit and produced 135 cars; this grew to 1,149 cars by 1906. The company then went public selling shares via the Milan stock exchange. Agnelli led the company until his death in 1945, while Vittorio Valletta administered the firm's daily activities. Its first car, the 3 \u00bd CV (of which only 24 copies were built, all bodied by Alessio of Turin)[9] was based on a design purchased from Ceirano GB & C and had a 697\u00a0cc (42.5\u00a0cu\u00a0in) boxer twin engine.[10] In 1903, Fiat produced its first truck.[11] In 1908, the first Fiat was exported to the US.[11] That same year, the first Fiat aircraft engine was produced. Also around the same time, Fiat taxis became popular in Europe.[12] By 1910, Fiat was the largest automotive company in Italy. That same year, a new plant was built in Poughkeepsie, NY, by the newly founded American F.I.A.T. Automobile Company.[13][14] Owning a Fiat at that time was a sign of distinction. The cost of a Fiat in the US was initially $4,000[15] and rose up to $6,400 in 1918,[16] compared to $825 for a Ford Model T in 1908,[17] and $525 in 1918, respectively.[18] During World War I, Fiat had to devote all of its factories to supplying the Allies with aircraft, engines, machine guns, trucks, and ambulances. Upon the entry of the US into the war in 1917, the factory was shut down as US regulations became too burdensome. After the war, Fiat introduced its first tractor, the 702.[19] By the early 1920s, Fiat had a market share in Italy of 80%.[20] In 1921, workers seized Fiat's plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them. Agnelli responded by quitting the company. However, the Italian Socialist Party and its ally organization, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, in an effort to effect a compromise with the centrist parties ordered the occupation ended. In 1922, Fiat began to build the famous Lingotto car factory\u2014then the largest in Europe\u2014which opened in 1923. It was the first Fiat factory to use assembly lines; by 1925, Fiat controlled 87% of the Italian car market.[21] In 1928, with the 509, Fiat included insurance in the purchase price.[22] Fiat made military machinery and vehicles during World War II for the Army and Regia Aeronautica and later for the Germans. Fiat made obsolete fighter aircraft like the biplane CR.42, which was one of the most common Italian aircraft, along with Savoia-Marchettis, as well as light tanks (obsolete compared to their German and Soviet counterparts) and armoured vehicles. The best Fiat aircraft was the G.55 fighter, which arrived too late and in too limited numbers. In 1945, the year Benito Mussolini was overthrown, the National Liberation Committee removed the Agnelli family from leadership roles in Fiat because of its ties to Mussolini's government. They were not returned until 1963, when Giovanni's grandson, Gianni, took over as general manager until 1966, as chairman until 1996. In 1970, Fiat employed more than 100,000 in Italy when its production reached the highest number, 1.4\u00a0million cars, in that country.[4] As of 2002, Fiat built more than 1 million vehicles at six plants in Italy and the country accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue.[4] Towards the end of 1976 it was announced that the Libyan government was to take a shareholding in the company in return for a capital injection. Other aspects of the Libyan agreement included the construction of a truck and bus plant at Tripoli. Chairman Agnelli candidly described the deal as \"a classic petro-money recycling operation which will strengthen the Italian reserves, provide Fiat with fresh capital and give the group greater tranquility in which to carry out its investment programmes\".[23] On 29 January 2014, it was announced that Fiat S.p.A. (the former owner of Fiat Group) was to be merged into a new Netherlands-based holding company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), took place before the end of 2014. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles became the new owner of Fiat Group.[24] On 1 August 2014, Fiat S.p.A. received necessary shareholder approval to proceed with the merger,[25] which became effective 12 October 2014.[26][27] Fiat's main market is Europe, mainly focused in Italy. Historically successful in citycars and supermini sector, currently Fiat has a range of models focused on those two segments (in 2011, those accounted for the 84% of its sales). Fiat does not currently offer any large family car, nor an executive car - these market segments have, to some extent been covered by the Lancia and Alfa Romeo brands,  which Fiat also owns. Fiat's share of the European market shrank from 9.4 per cent in 2000 to 5.8 per cent in the summer of 2004. At this point Sergio Marchionne was appointed as Fiat's chief executive. By March 2009 their market share had expanded to 9.1 per cent.[28] Fiat built their five-story Lingotto plant in 1915 through 1918, at the time it was Europe's largest car manufacturing plant.[29] Later the Mirafiori plant was built, also in Turin. To prepare for production of the all-new Fiat 128, Fiat opened their Rivalta plant in October 1968. Until the 128 entered production, the plant was used to build sports versions of the 850 and 124 as well as parts for the Fiat Dino.[30] Fiat's 2018 range of passenger car engines comprised eleven units, eight petrols and three diesels.[31] Their current range of models is the following: Fiat sales in 2011 were up to 676,704 (less 17.3% versus the previous year):[32] Light commercial vehicles are sold in Europe under the brand Fiat Professional. Fiat was importing cars to the UK market by the outbreak of World War II in 1939 (with the two countries on opposite sides), but its market share increased rapidly during the 1970s, with the 127 supermini and 128 range of small family cars being the biggest sellers, selling largely on practicality and efficiency. Its market share increased further during the 1980s with the Fiat Uno (imported to the UK from June 1983) being the company's best seller in the UK, and its share fell sharply in the early 1990s before the arrival of the Punto in March 1994 rejuvenated the company's UK fortunes. The second generation Punto was a strong seller in the UK after its October 1999 launch, but the new modern day Fiat 500 (launched there in January 2008) has accounted for most of the company's UK sales in more recent years. The original Fiat 500 had been one of the few direct competitors for the iconic Mini during its 1960s heyday.[33] Fiat has invested for a long time in South America, mainly in Brazil (where has been the market leader for many years) and in Argentina. They built their first Brazilian car plant in the Greater Belo Horizonte city of Betim in 1973, after having begun by building tractors there.[34] The Brazilian range is similar to European one, with the addition of a special family which derives from a common platform (called \"Project 178\"): Palio Weekend, Palio Adventure, Strada. Recently a range of new models developed in Brazil has been launched: Uno, Palio, Grand Siena, Fiorino. Other European models are currently imported to Brazil: Fiat 500. Fiat sells in Brazil under the Fiat brand, European Fiat Professional light commercial vehicles as: Fiat has a long history in the United States. In 1908, the Fiat Automobile Co. was established in the country and a plant in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,[35][36] began producing Fiats a year later, like the Fiat 60 HP and the Fiat 16-20 HP.[37] These luxury cars were produced long before Chrysler Corp. was formed in 1925 from older manufacturers that were acquired by Walter P. Chrysler, the founder.[38] The New Jersey factory was closed when the U.S. entered  World War I in 1917.[citation needed] Fiat returned to North America in the 1950s, selling the original 500, Fiat 600 Multipla, Fiat 1100, Fiat 1200, and the Fiat 1300.[39] Models produced in those years include the Fiat 124 Sport Spider and the Fiat X1/9.[40][41] Partly as a result, Fiat sales in the US fell from a high of 100,511 cars in 1975 to 14,113 in 1982.[40] In 1983, Fiat left the United States car market with a reputation for poor quality cars in North America, mostly rust and poor reliability.[42] In January 2009, the Fiat Group acquired a 20% stake in US automaker Chrysler LLC.[43] The deal saw the return of the Fiat brand to North America after a 25-year absence. The first Fiat-branded model to appear was the internationally popular Fiat 500 city car. The Fiat 500 model is built at Chrysler's assembly plant in Toluca, Mexico, which currently makes also the Dodge Journey and Fiat Freemont crossovers.[44] Fiat is also selling their commercial vehicles Fiat Ducato and Fiat Dobl\u00f2 in North America, rebranded as Ram ProMaster and Ram ProMaster City respectively. Fiat passenger cars began assembly in South Africa in 1950, and full production in their Rosslyn plant commenced in 1966.[45] Sales reached a peak market share of about five percent around 1970 but then dropped precipitously. A new 128-based half-ton pickup truck helped turn the situation around.[46] It also assembled in Egypt through El-Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company which assembled FIAT brands 125-127-128 Fiat's presence in Chinese market is limited compared to its European, Japanese, Korean and American rivals. At the beginning of 2012, Fiat was only importing Fiat Bravo and Fiat 500 model. However, in 2012 Fiat and GAC opened a joint venture plant to produce the first Fiat vehicle specifically developed for Chinese market ever: the Fiat Viaggio, a compact car derived by another model of Fiat SpA group, the Dodge Dart (in turn derived by another Fiat Group car, the Alfa Romeo Giulietta). Fiat currently offers to Japanese consumers the 500 in both coupe and convertible bodystyles, and the Panda. Both vehicles are in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations affording the Japanese public to purchase a non-Japanese vehicle without having to pay an annual tax for driving a car that exceeds the regulations. Fiat is also present in the Indian market since 1948. Current presence is in joint venture with Tata Motors, although current car sales (Fiat is currently offering the Fiat Punto and  Fiat Linea) are niche market and limited (approx. 20k units in 2011). The Fiat 500 (Italian: cinquecento, Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02cct\u0283i\u014bkwe\u02c8t\u0283\u025bnto]) is a car produced by the Fiat company of Italy between 1957 and 1975, with limited production of the Fiat 500 K estate continuing until 1977. The car was designed by Dante Giacosa. Redesigned in 2007, it is currently distributed worldwide. The Fiat Panda is a city car from the Italian automotive manufacturer Fiat. Current version is the third one distributed as from 2012. The Fiat 500L enlarges, as from September 2012, the Fiat 500 family with a Mini MPV which replace the Fiat Idea. The model is produced in the new Fiat plant in Serbia. The platform is the same of the Fiat Punto.[47] Argo is the car that replaced Fiat Palio and Punto for the Brazilian Market produced in Betim - MG Brazil The Cronos is going to be produced in Argentina in Cordoba and is going to be in the place of Siena and Grand Siena. The new pickup will took place of Strada, but the project is on hold. The Fiat Palio is a supermini designed by Fiat as a world car, aimed at developing countries. The Palio Weekend is a small family car station wagon; an extended version of the hatchback Palio. The Fiat Grand Siena is the four-door sedan version of the second generation of the Fiat Palio, a small family car especially designed for developing countries. The European Car of the Year award has been awarded twelve times to the Fiat Group over the last forty years, more than any other manufacturer. Nine of these awards were won by Fiat Automobiles models. Fiat models awarded the title: Fiat Automobiles, one of Europe's 10 best-selling automotive brands, has for the second year running been confirmed as having the lowest average value for CO2 emissions from vehicles sold in 2008: 133.7 g/km (137.3 g/km in 2007). This was corroborated by JATO, a provider of automotive data.[49] Fiat started development of electric vehicles back in the mid 1970s, with the concept Fiat X1/23. More recently in 2008, Fiat showed the Phylla concept,[50] and the Fiat Bugster concept in Brazil.[51] Fiat joined utility companies Cemig and Itaipu to develop new electric vehicles for Brazil, with production in 2009 of the Palio Weekend Electric.[52] Fiat launched the electric 500e in California in 2013, but no sales were planned for Europe.[53] Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne claimed in 2014 that each one was sold at a loss of $14,000.[54]       In 1971 the Fiat 124 Sport Spider was prepared for the World Rally Championship when Abarth became involved with its production and development and from 1972 had relative success with two wins in 1972, one in 1973 and won 1st, 2nd and 3rd in the 1974 Portuguese TAP Rally.[58] The  Fiat 131 Abarth was a very successful rally car replacing the 124. Between 1976 and 1981 the Fiat 131 won 18 World Rally Championship events,[59] resulting in winning the WRC Drivers Championship two times: in 1978, and in 1980, and winning the WRC Constructors Championship three times: in 1977, 1978, and in 1980.[60] Lancia took over the role of motorsport for the Fiat Group during the 1980s. After a long break of factory-supported entries, in 2003 a Fiat Punto S1600 won the Italian Rally Championship, and 2006 the Fiat Grande Punto S2000 won the FIA European Rally Championship,[61] followed by three successive wins in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The FIAT initials were first used in the distinctive logo form 1901.[62] Beginning in 1931, the company began using a single red shield without a wreath.  In 1968 the \"rhomboid\" logo (as it was known internally) was introduced which featured the FIAT initials spelled out on four interconnected rhombuses.  The rhomboid was slowly phased in during the early 1970s, although the older \"laurel wreath\" style FIAT badge was used to denote sporting models such as the 124 Spider, 127 Sport, X1/9 and the tuned Abarth models.  A new corporate nose based on the rhomboid logo was first introduced in 1983 on the Uno, which consisted of five chrome bars inclined at an angle of 18 degrees to mirror the rhomboid, which usually appeared in reduced size at the corner of the grille. In 1999 the wreath style logo was re-introduced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the company. Fiat launched its Motor Village flagship store concept in 2006, with its Mirafiori Motor Village in Turin, followed by London's on Wigmore Street in 2008[63] and Paris's on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in 2010.[64] In 2009, BSM (the British School of Motoring) ended a 16-year relationship with Vauxhall Motors and signed a deal with Fiat UK to swap its learner vehicle from the Vauxhall Corsa to the new Fiat 500. Fiat UK will supply 14,000 cars to BSM over four years in a marketing deal.[65] ",

Already the largest shipbuilder in Europe, after the acquisition of Vard in 2013 and 50% of STX France in 2018, Fincantieri group doubled in size to become the fourth largest in the world.[2] The company builds both commercial and military vessels. The company is listed on the Borsa Italiana (Milan Stock Exchange) and is a component of FTSE Italia Mid Cap Index. Fincantieri designs and builds merchant vessels, passenger ships, offshore, and naval vessels, and is also active in the conversion and ship repair sectors. The company also owned Grandi Motori Trieste, which constructed marine diesel engines, but this was sold to W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 in 1999.[3] Founded in 1959 as Societ\u00e0 Finanziaria Cantieri Navali \u2013 Fincantieri S.p.A. as a State financial holding company,[4] part of IRI, the company became a separate entity in 1984. Today Fincantieri is one of Europe's largest shipbuilding groups and the largest in the Mediterranean.[5] Fincantieri employs a staff of about 10,000 (rising to approximately 20,000 if the supply chain is included) working at eight shipyards, two design centres, one research centre and two production sites for mechanical components. The shipyards of Monfalcone (Gorizia), Marghera (Venice), Sestri Ponente (Genoa), Ancona, Castellammare di Stabia (Naples) and Palermo report to the Merchant Ships Business Unit while the shipyards of Riva Trigoso (Genoa) and Muggiano (La Spezia) report to the Naval Vessel Business Unit. Fincantieri successfully completed the acquisition of Manitowoc Marine Group from its parent company The Manitowoc Company, Inc. on 1 January 2009, which consisted of two shipyards in Wisconsin, including Marinette Marine, which built the first Freedom-class littoral combat ship. Fincantieri also purchased from Manitowoc Marine Group a topside repair yard in Ohio and one production plant in Wisconsin, making it one of the leading mid-sized shipbuilders in the United States for commercial and government customers, including the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.[6] Already the largest shipbuilder in Europe, after the acquisition of Vard the Fincantieri group doubled in size to become the fourth largest in the world.[2] In March 2015, Fincantieri won its biggest ever independent order from Carnival Corporation & plc in a 4 billion euro deal commissioning the company to build five new cruise ships.[7] Fincantieri is currently in talks with the French government to purchase part of the majority of STX ship building although negotiations are ongoing and controversial[2]. On 2 February 2018, Fincantieri announced an agreement for 50 per cent of STX France valued at 59.7 million euro.[8] In March 2018, Fincantieri established Fincantieri Services USA - a subsidiary based in Miami, Florida, USA.[9] Coordinates: 45\u00b038\u203208.08\u2033N 13\u00b046\u203232.56\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff45.6355778\u00b0N 13.7757111\u00b0E\ufeff / 45.6355778; 13.7757111 ",

            "text": "Fiocchi Munizioni (Fiocchi Ammunition) is one of Italy's largest and oldest manufacturers of ammunition. The company's headquarters and main production plant are in Via Santa Barbara in Lecco, Italy. Fiocchi Munizioni was founded on 3 July 1876 in Lecco, Italy, by accountant Giulio Fiocchi. In 1876, Giulio Fiocchi took over the ammunition production part of a weapon and ammunition company already based in Lecco, which produced small-caliber ammunition.[citation needed] At that time a radical change was introduced in firearms: the newly developed breech-loader replaced the traditional muzzle loader. Fiocchi started manufacturing cases with primers suitable for reloading; in the early 1890s production was extended to complete cartridges loaded with bullets or shot. At the same time, Fiocchi gave up the production of black powder, as it was no longer profitable. At the beginning of the 20th century, Fiocchi diversified and began making snap fasteners  using scraps from cartridge production. Fiocchi Snaps was formed in 1903. It assumed an important role to counterbalance the trend of the ammunition market, but at the end of the 1980s Fiocchi made a decision to focus on ammunition as its core business, and the snaps factory was sold. During its long life, Fiocchi has manufactured all kinds of ammunition from pinfire, shotshells, and cartridges to all kinds of cartridges and cases, both rimfire and centerfire. They are known for manufacturing rarer cartridges for collectors and enthusiasts, for example the .455 Webley. Fiocchi Munizioni makes small gauge ammunition and offers a wide range of products. Its presence and production sites are also in the United States and in Hungary. In 2008 Fiocchi UK was opened in Great Britain. According to a recent interview with Carlo Fiocchi, the head of Fiocchi America, more than 75% of the ammunition sold by Fiocchi in the United States is also manufactured in the United States at Fiocchi America's production facility in Ozark, Missouri.[1]  Specifically, Fiocchi America's composition of U.S. ammo manufacturing and sales according to the interview is as follows: Qualifications and Certifications of prestige attest the level of quality achieved by the company: Furthermore, Fiocchi shooting cartridges have contributed to several World Cups and Olympic triumphs, as the Games in Athens in 2004 as well as in those in Beijing in 2008.[citation needed] In 2011 newly developed 12GA shot shells filled with chemical tracer Cyalume in which allows the shooter to see where the shots are going and will greatly help in the training of sporting clays.  The tracer shots are non-toxic and biodegradable and packaged in a sealed metal can in Fiocchi's line of Canned Heat ammunition.  The Canned Heat line of ammunition allows a greater shelf life and maintaining quality of the ammo throughout shipping, retail shelf, and consumer handling. Fiocchi Munizioni is still entirely owned by private capital heading to the Fiocchi Family. In partnership with Smith & Wesson, the Fiocchi family had a factory in Alton, Illinois, in the 1950s. Diverging company interests caused Fiocchi to sell its share to Smith & Wesson and withdraw from the American market. Great grandson Carlo Fiocchi joined the family business in 1980 at the age of 24 and worked as a product manager in charge of the English-speaking market, his assignment no doubt influenced by the fact that his grandmother was British. His responsibilities included overseeing its meager exports to the United States. Carlo traveled to the United States on his honeymoon, with instructions to bring back marketing research for a US facility. Carlo concluded that opportunities could not be exploited unless Fiocchi had a physical presence. In 1983, a FOA facility was built in Springfield, Missouri, to import ammunition, the location selected because of his father\u2019s existing contacts there and that it offered the most favorable rail and trucking costs. After a year and a half they realized that importing loaded ammunition was not an effective business model. The company couldn\u2019t react fast enough to the needs of the US shooters. Carlo returned to Italy and convinced the president, Paolo, to build a manufacturing plant on a farm he identified in the Ozarks near Springfield.  Fiocchi negotiated a purchase with the farmer and loans with the bank. Providing a platform for quality manufacturing jobs, the Fiocchi enterprise was enthusiastically welcomed by the local government. Nevertheless, in 2005, Pietro, Carlo and Donna Swafford, chief operations manager, boldly attempted to revitalize the company in April 2005. Due in large measure to their acumen, since then FOA sales have increased 500%. The US subsidiary imports empty primed hulls from Fiocchi Munizioni and wads from Italy, produced mainly by Baschieri & Pellagri and Gualandi in Bologna, a world capital of machine shop engineering, home to Ferrari, Lamborghini and Ducati - and the ancestral home of the Fiocchi family. Fiocchi's product range includes: ",

            "text": " Fondmetal S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of alloy wheels, founded in 1972 by Gabriele Rumi. A Formula One constructor of the same name, also owned by Rumi, competed in the 1991 and 1992 seasons, scoring no championship points. The company also sponsored, and supplied wheels to, numerous other constructors from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s. In 2014 the Fondmetal brand expanded to the United States and became known as Fondmetal USA. All wheels continue to be made in Italy and are TUV approved. In 1961, Gabriele Rumi took over the iron foundry business that had been established by his grandfather in Brescia.[1] A motor racing enthusiast, the business allowed him to compete in hillclimbs and in the Formula Monza category during the 1960s. Rumi had a passion for cars and racing and saw a demand for the manufacturing of parts for the automobile industry. In Palosco they made induction manifolds, water conduits, clutch bellhousing, oil pumps, cylinder heads and engine blocks for clients such as Maserti Biturbo, Fiat, Iveco, OM and Magneti Marelli. For Rumi this was not enough. He found himself too reliant on his customers in a sensitive time period following the oil crisis. This led him to the courageous decision of launching his own product line in 1972. The choice of product was alloy wheels due to this involvement and passion for the automobile industry. From there the Fondmetal brand grew and was established as a leader in forged and cost wheel design, engineering and manufacturing in Italy. Fondmetal first appeared in Formula One in 1983 as a sponsor for Italian driver Piercarlo Ghinzani. In the mid-1980s, the company supplied wheels to Williams, Tyrrell and Ligier, while continuing to sponsor Ghinzani and, later, the Osella team. In 1989, Fondmetal became Osella's major sponsor, and by 1990 Rumi had become the team's majority shareholder.[2] At the end of that year, he decided to take over the whole operation. Rumi transferred the team from Volpiano near Torino to his headquarters in Bergamo and ran it for one and a half years on his own. He initially persevered with Osella's driver, Olivier Grouillard, until he tired of the Frenchman's reckless side and attitude problem, replacing him with Gabriele Tarquini. The new team was no more successful than in the Osella days, sometimes the results being even worse than those of its fellow back row contenders Coloni or AGS. For the 1991 Formula One season, Osella Squadra Corse was gone; the team re-appeared as Fondmetal Corse. Initially, Fondmetal entered the FA1M-E car which was a mere carry-over from the previous year (and, in fact, from 1989 as Osella had not been able to construct a new car in 1990). Driven by Olivier Grouillard, the blue and grey coloured machine was uncompetitive by any means. In the first two races of the season, Grouillard was slower than everyone else. Although Fondmetal was able to use Cosworth engines prepared by Brian Hart from previous years' Tyrrell's engines, even Pedro Chaves in his Coloni was ahead of the Fondmetal car. In that hostile atmosphere, pre-qualification turned out to be impossible. But Rumi had high hopes for the European season. By the San Marino Grand Prix, a new car appeared, called the Fomet-1. It was conceived by a newly founded think-tank in the UK called Fomet. The Bicester-based design office was headed by Tino Belli and founded by Rumi who thought that British input was necessary for gaining success. The Fomet-1 featured new aerodynamics, a new suspension and some other improvements, but apart from this, the new car obviously preserved its Osella roots. Finally, things improved a little, but not significantly. With the new car, Grouillard managed to be faster than the Coloni machine, but that does not mean that Fondmetal was able to pass pre-qualifying regularly. Only a handful of race participations were possible, but results were poor, although he qualified 10th for the 1991 Mexican Grand Prix, ahead of Andrea de Cesaris in the Jordan, who finished 4th. In the end, Grouillard was replaced by former AGS man Gabriele Tarquini who finished twice (from three attempts), although he also failed to pre-qualify once; but no points were scored in the end. At the end of 1991, due to some financial troubles, the British Fomet subsidiary where the designers had been working on a new Formula One car since the previous summer found its way into independence. Tino Belli sold the layout of the new car to the French Larrousse Formula One team which left Fondmetal without a new car for the next season. Instead, Gabriele Rumi commissioned Sergio Rinland from Astauto to design a new machine late in December 1991. Naturally, it was not ready for the season opening so for the first few races, last year's car had to be used again. Now dubbed GR01, it had seen few modifications; the major change was the installation of a Ford HB V8 engine (a carry-over from last year's Benetton machine) that came instead of the Lamborghini V12 or the Judd V10 that Rumi had preferred. The engine and the chassis did not go together well. There were some cooling troubles, and reliability was poor. The team appeared with two drivers, one being Tarquini, the other one being the Swiss debutant Andrea Chiesa. Tarquini showed speed, but the car was fragile. Things got better in late spring when the new chassis found its way on the circuits. The GR02 had nothing in common with former years' Osellas and Fondmetals. The roots of its design dated back to late 1991 when Sergio Rinland was working for the Brabham team on the new Brabham BT61 that never saw the light of day. Instead, the basic structures of this design were carried over to the 1992 Fondmetal. Hence, the GR02 had some qualities and indeed was well regarded by its drivers. However, results turned out to be disappointing, with minor problems often stopping the cars after they qualified well. The team had little funds so tests were few and development slow. Finishes were rare. Tarquini often qualified this car surprisingly high up the order, and at the Belgian Grand Prix put in Fondmetal's best qualifying performance of the season to qualify 11th. Chiesa never got going, however, usually failing to qualify, and was replaced by Eric van de Poele for the Hungarian Grand Prix. While Eric proved competitive, he also collided with Tarquini in Hungary, losing the Italian team's last chance of a points finish. Two races later, in September 1992, the team withdrew from the championship, feeling the pinch of the worldwide recession and of not scoring better than a pair of 10th places, although Tarquini managed to qualify for all the thirteen races in which the team participated in 1992 and Chiesa (in ten attempts) and van de Poele (in only three) qualified three times each. During 1992 Sergio Rinland and his Astauto team started to work on a 1993 F1 car in the hope that Fondmetal would carry on. That was not the case, since the contract was cancelled by Fondmetal in September 1992, well before the end of the season due to lack of funds. The design of that car was finished in early 1993. A year later, Rinland sold that design to Guido Forti who started running a Formula One team called Forti by 1995. The team's FG01 chassis still had several similarities to the, by then very old, 1992 Fondmetal GR02. Rumi would return to Formula One in a more modest capacity in 1994, with Fondmetal sponsoring Tyrrell, and for 1996 would switch his support to Minardi. Fondmetal also owned a wind tunnel in Northern Italy that was leased to Tyrrell, Minardi and other teams. Rumi would gradually increase his interest in the Faenza outfit, becoming co-owner and chairman. However, Rumi was diagnosed with cancer, and was forced to withdraw his backing in 2000 when the team was sold to Paul Stoddart. Rumi eventually died in May 2001. Fondmetal is still in operation as a wheel manufacturer. (key) ",

It is currently headquartered in Monza, Italy. The company sells products to both individuals and hospitality clientele. It has 9 retail locations in the United States, 25 in Asia, and many more around the world. In 1999, the descendants of the company's founders ceded the company to an Italian fashion group. Jean Baptiste Ennemonde (Edmond) Chavasse Frette was born on June 12, 1838, in Grenoble, France, from Jean Claude Chavasse Frette, a fabric dyer, merchant and manufacturer of socks and knitted shirts, and Marie Mar\u00e9chal.  After her husband's death, in 1840, Marie took up the activity of millinery to support her children. On December 1, 1860, Edmond Frette--together with Charles Chaboud and Alexandre Payre--established \"Frette, Payre & Chaboud\", for \"the commerce and manufacture of  fabrics.\"  Charles Chaboud became the financial officer, and Alexandre and Edmond took the roles of traveling merchants.  As a traveling merchant, Edmond started in Italy, which was not only an export market but also a source of raw materials. Edmond first established himself in the Versilia area in Tuscany. There, Edmond also met his future wife, the Italian Ersilia Bresciani. Between 1862 and 1863, Edmond Frette arrived in Monza. There, established another branch of the company, and in the second half of the 1860s, Edmond was able to concentrate production under the roofs of his own factories: in Concorezzo, products for the private individuals; in Sovico, coarse products for the large communities (hotels, the army, boarding-schools). The latter production represented by large the most important part of Frette's trade. In 1881, Frette won the Gold Medal Award at the National Exhibition in Milan for the quality of its products, and in that year Frette also became an official \"Provider to the Royal House.\" Sales by mail catalog began in 1886, which was important at the time since most of Italy's population was agricultural, and a great part of the population lived far away from the big towns that had shops. Frette's mail catalog business ran for 90 years, and the last mail-order catalog was issued in 1976. Frette opened a store in Rome (1887) and, shortly later, in Turin (1889).  Frette later opened stores in Genoa (1902) and Florence (1904). On August 29, 1909, Edmond Frette died at age 71. Until 1999, Frette was owned by the descendants of Edmond Frette's Italian backers, Giuseppe Maggi and Carlo Antonietti. That year, it was sold to the financial company Fin.part.[1] JH Partners, a private equity firm, acquired Frette in 2005.[2] The company provides linens to the following hotels worldwide, including: ",

Fulgor's global headquarters are located in Gallarate, Italy; roughly 25 miles north of Milan in the heart of Italy's Lombardy Region.  The company's products compete with those made by companies  Bosch, Dacor, Miele, Viking Range, Asko , or Smeg. Fulgor was founded by Mr. Piero Puricelli in 1949 shortly after he began working on a coal-powered cooker he hoped to develop.  Piero chose the name Fulgor for his budding company because of its Latin meaning; \"to shine\".[1]  The company began mass producing their first line of coal-powered cookers, or ranges as they're known in North America, in 1955.  Beginning later, in 1974, Fulgor began production of built-in gas cooktops and electric wall ovens.  In the early 1990s, the company became one of the first manufacturers to introduce \"gas on glass\" cooktops and self-cleaning wall ovens.  By 1994 Fulgor's products had caught the eye of many key global appliance brands, and the company began exporting its product to North America and other parts of Europe.[2] Before pushing for greater exposure of their own branded line of appliances in the early 2000s, Fulgor was historically known a key global finished goods supplier to several of the major appliance brands in Europe and North America.  In Europe, Fulgor has supplied finished product to the following manufacturing & retail brands: Whirlpool Europe, Auchan, BUT, Carrefour, Conforama, Corte Ingles, Electric Depot and Ocean, among others.  In North America, Fulgor was the first European brand to export cooking appliances to North American manufacturing brands.  To date, the company has worked with brands like KitchenAid, GE Monogram, Bosch, Viking Range  and Fagor. Fulgor used to be marketed in North America under the FCI label. As of 2009, Fulgor operated eight sales offices globally, according to their company website.  The company sells its product across Europe, North America and Australia, with product selling in at least 15 separate nations. The company's North American division was first opened in 2005, and later reorganized under the name Fulgor USA, LLC in 2008 with the slogan \"arte culinaria\", Italian for \"culinary art\".  The North American division is headquartered in St. Joseph, MI.  The product line in North America consists of built in ovens, gas and electric cooktops, microwaves, dishwashers and an electric grill called La Scappi.[citation needed] ",

The founder, Achille Gaggia, applied for a patent (patent number 365726) for the first modern steamless coffee machine on September 5, 1938, to be used commercially in his coffee bar. The machine forced water to flow over the coffee grounds at a high pressure, producing the 'crema' that is unique to espresso. The Gaggia company was founded in 1947 and formally incorporated in 1948. It first produced machines for commercial use, but shortly thereafter released the Gilda, its first home machine.[1] The company continues to produce espresso machines (as well as accessories) from classic manual machines to the innovative semi-automatic and super-automatic models recently added to the line.[2] As of 2010, all Gaggia espresso and coffee machines are still manufactured in Milan at the Robecco sul Naviglio factory. The 2015 Gaggia Classic was built in Romania instead. The New Gaggia Classic is made in Italy again and uses an alumin boiler. The Gaggia S.p. A company was purchased in 1999 by fellow Italian competitor Saeco International Group, which in turn was purchased by Dutch manufacturer Philips in 2009.[3] Gaggia still operates a separate line but now is using Saeco designs in some of its domestic espresso machines. Before the takeover by Philips most domestic espresso machines from Gaggia had aluminium boilers. Now they have stainless steel boilers. ",

At age 22, Adalberto Garelli received a degree in engineering and dedicated his work to developing and perfecting the two-stroke engine for Fiat. Garelli quit in 1911 due to Fiat's lack of enthusiasm for the two-stroke engine. He continued his own engine design between 1911 and 1914 which resulted in the 350 cc split-single cylinder engine. Garelli worked for other motorcycle manufacturers from 1914 to 1918 during which time he won a competition organized by the Royal Italian Army to design a motorcycle with which he used his 350 cc split-single engine.  In 1919, Garelli constructed a 350\u00a0cc motorcycle which set a long distance record from Milan to Naples. Rider Ettore Girardi covered the 840\u00a0km (520\u00a0mi) with an average of 38.29\u00a0km/h (24\u00a0mph). Many famous Italian racers such as Ernesto Gnesa, Tazio Nuvolari and Achille Varzi began their racing careers on Garelli bikes. The Garelli 350\u00a0cc split-single stayed in production until 1926 and made a major impact in racing. The company also produced motorcycles for the Royal Italian Army. After World War II, Garelli concentrated on producing smaller bikes and mopeds for the European market. In the early 1980s, Garelli dominated the 125 class in Grand Prix motorcycle racing winning six consecutive world championships between 1982 and 1987. Garelli won the following World Titles:   ",

Garlando was founded officially in 1954 at Spinetta Marengo \u2013 a small village near Alessandria \u2013 by Renato Garlando, the father of the present managing director, already in the market for the production of various wood objects. An activity that he, in his turn, had inherited from his father. Following the success of table football, originating in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s,[1] and later the United States, Spain and France, Renato Garlando decided to produce them for the Italian market, where he had unexpected success. From then on, the company continuously grew. Foreign countries were added to the domestic revenue, including overseas to the United States, where the Garlando football tables experienced a boom in the 1970s. During this time, Garlando began manufacturing pool tables with the same domestic success as with table football equipment. In the course of the 1980s, the current managing director, Giuseppe Garlando, took the lead and, with his brother Marino, began renovating the working procedures which, from still largely craftsmanlike, became industrialised and standardised. In the same period the factory dimensions enlarged, the number of the employees increased, while they become more and more skilled, new computerised machinery is purchased to reach the utmost precision in the output, new foreign markets are open on which Garlando soon becomes a leader. In the 1990s, the North Africa and Eastern Europe markets were tapped, and the product range was expanded to meet the requirements of new segments of public. To meet more and more urgent production requirements, late in 2002 the company left Spinetta Marengo to move to their much more modern premises at Pozzolo Formigaro, near Novi Ligure, a dozen kilometres from the old site. The company now covers a 10,000 square metre area, equipped with the most modern machines to work the wood as well as to mould the plastic. The new location employs over 60 people, both for the office and the factory. ",

The brand name, Geox, was created from a mixture between the Greek word \u201cgeo\u201d (earth), and \u201cx\u201d, a letter-element symbolizing technology.[citation needed] Polegato was born in 1952[3] near Treviso. Originally groomed to take over the family wine-making business, company promotional material has it the idea for the shoe came when he participated in a wine industry conference in Reno; while out jogging in Reno's hot desert climate, his feet got hot from the exertion and he had the idea to cut a couple of holes in the soles of his shoes with a Swiss Army knife. He developed the idea into a viable product with the help of a small leather-goods business his family owned. After unsuccessfully pitching his invention to several established footwear manufacturers, but after having passed the market testing phase for a line of children\u2019s footwear, Polegato began large-scale production of shoes under the Geox brand name. That same year, he improved the original patent and extended the product range to men\u2019s and women\u2019s footwear.[citation needed] The Geox group has consistently invested in innovation, ever since it was founded. Its Montebelluna head offices are host to R&D facilities, which are unique in their kind[citation needed]. Here, 15 engineers, chemists and physicists are employed in research on perspiration and human-generated heat-movement patterns, testing all materials used in their footwear and manufacturing clothing. The Montebelluna-based team of scientists have created and patented new machinery to help them pursue their research. Geox also works with major research labs and universities to test and refine new technology.[citation needed] ",

            "text": "Gilera is an Italian motorcycle manufacturer founded in Arcore in 1909 by Giuseppe Gilera. In 1969, the company was purchased by  Piaggio. In 1935, Gilera acquired rights to the Rondine four-cylinder engine. It was at that time, the world's most powerful engine with 45\u00a0kW (60\u00a0hp). The first across-the-frame 4-cylinder motorcycle was the racer 1939 Gilera 500 Rondine. It had double-over-head camshafts, forced-inducting supercharger and was water-cooled, producing 60\u00a0kW (80\u00a0hp) @9000 and had a top speed of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h).[1] This formed the basis for Gilera' s racing machines for nearly forty years. From the mid-thirties, Gilera developed a range of four-stroke engine machines. The engines ranged from 100 to 500\u00a0cc, the most famous being the 1939 Saturno. Designed by Giuseppe Salmaggi, the Saturno was inspired by the pre-war Gilera VTEGS 500\u00a0cc \u201cOtto Bulloni\u201d yet was quite different due to its unit construction.[2] After withdrawing from competition in 1957, Gilera changed direction abruptly. They downplayed their hitherto successful line of four-stroke singles and began to focus on motocross and off-road events in association with independent specialist Elmeca. Sales declined through the 1960s and by 1968 the company was in receivership.[3] In 1969, Gilera became part of the Piaggio group. In 1992, Gilera made a return to the Grand Prix arena and Piaggio continues to produce small-displacement motorcycles with the Gilera name. The famous factory of Arcore was closed in 1993 and now the motorcycles (only scooters) bearing the name Gilera are produced by Piaggio in Pontedera. After World War II, Gilera dominated Grand Prix motorcycle racing, winning the 500\u00a0cc road racing world championship six times in eight years.[citation needed] Facing a downturn in motorcycle sales due to the increase in the popularity of automobiles after the war, Gilera made a gentleman's agreement with the other Italian motorcycle makers to quit Grand Prix racing after the 1957 season as a cost-cutting measure. The 1957 500\u00a0cc machines on which former World Champion rider Geoff Duke had much success were resurrected in 1963, but with the benefit of newer, upgraded tyre technology of the 1960s were considered still competitive. The team was devised by Duke to challenge the domination of Mike Hailwood on the MV and had early successes with riders Derek Minter and teammate John Hartle at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and Imola, Italy. In May 1963 Minter suffered serious injuries when racing a Norton at Brands Hatch, and his place in the team for the TT races was taken by Phil Read, who came third to second-place teammate Hartle. The team only raced for one season in selected races. In 1966 Minter arranged to ride the Gileras at the TT in June,[4] again without success as he crashed on a wet road surface after a rain shower at Brandish Corner during the last practice before race-week, breaking his left wrist which ended his racing for the rest of the race season. The bikes were raced at Brands Hatch later in the year.[5] Gilera won the following World Titles: ",

            "text": "Ansaldo was one of Italy's oldest and most important engineering companies, existing for 140 years from 1853 to 1993. The company was founded in 1853 as Gio. Ansaldo & C. S.A.S. by renowned players in the Genoese business world, such as Giovanni Ansaldo, Raffaele Rubattino, Giacomo Filippo Penco and Carlo Bombrini. Until the end of the 19th century, the company focused on manufacturing and repairing railway components, quickly becoming a 10,000-worker company with seven factories, and starting to expand into sectors such as shipbuilding and mechanical works in general. In 1904, Ansaldo was bought by Ferdinando Maria Perrone who, along with his sons Mario and Pio, bound the name of the Perrone family to the history of the company. Over the next twenty years, he aimed at making Ansaldo fully independent both in the ironworks and weapon-making areas, thanks to strong vertical integration. The onset of World War I was of obvious potential benefit to the company, though Italy was initially neutral. Ansaldo advocated for Italian entry into the war, both directly and by funding political groups that supported the war, such as Benito Mussolini's proto-Fascist movement. [1] The efforts paid off when Italy entered the war. In 1914 the company was worth 30 million lire, but its market value grew to 500 million in 1918. When the company issued shares in the summer of 1918 worth 400 million lire Ansaldo employed 80,000 workers, had dozens of factories and controlled companies such as A. Cerpelli & C., Banca industriale Italiana, Cantieri Officine Savoia, Dynamit Nobel, Gio.Fossati & C., Lloyd Italico, Nazionale di Navigazione, Pomilio, Societ\u00e0 Idroelettrica Negri, and Transatlantica Italiana. Following a financial crisis with its largest creditor, Banca Italiana di Sconto, and problems in reconverting factories after the end of World War I, the Perrone family abandoned the company in 1921, and the Banca d'Italia led a consortium to save it from bankruptcy.  Company strategies were drastically sized down, and during the 1920s, even though electro-mechanical productions grew significantly, Ansaldo found itself in such dire difficulties that it finally entered the control of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), under which the company found new life and growth, partly thanks to the new war effort during fascism.  The main figure in this rebirth, the engineer Agostino Rocca, reconfigured the structure and organisation of the company during his tenure as chief executive officer from 1935 to the end of World War II.  War contracts indeed led to a significant growth: Ansaldo had 22,000 employees in 1939, and 35,000 in 1943. After the end of World War II, conversion to peacetime production again caused problems for the company. In 1948, IRI entrusted the company to Finmeccanica, which operated several reorganisation measures during the 1950s and 1960s, such as the relinquishing of all shipbuilding activities to Italcantieri of Trieste in 1966. From that year, Finmeccanica further engaged Ansaldo within its activities, and in 1980 they formed Italy's largest thermo-electric group. In 1993, Ansaldo ceased to exist as an independent entity, having been completely absorbed by Finmeccanica. Some companies controlled by Finmeccanica (now Leonardo S.p.A.) [2] still bear the Ansaldo family name: ",

Customers include McLaren, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Audi, Maserati , Alfa Romeo and Aston Martin, while some Mercedes-AMG models uses Graziano Power Transfer Unit .[3][4] Competitors are Germans ZF Friedrichshafen, Getrag and BorgWarner which produce modules for the Volkswagen DSG gearbox[5]. Graziano Trasmissioni was started in 1951 as a small family company with 15 employees by Carlo Graziano. In 1963, the company moved to its present headquarters in Cascine Vica. After 1981, the company's export activity increased progressively. The company then expanded, opening a factory in India in 1999, another in Suzhou (China) in 2006 and a third in Cerveny Kostelec (Czech Republic), in 2006. In 2007 it merged with North American Fairfield, becoming Oerlikon Drive Systems, part of the Oerlikon Group.

The Gallardo and the first-generation Audi R8 used a mid-engine Graziano gearbox (manual or automated manual versions). The DCT gearbox used in the new Audi R8 was developed in partnership with Graziano. It is built and pretested at Graziano's Luserna plant in Italy before shipment to Volkswagen's Kassel plant in Germany, where the clutch and mechatronics modules are added. The finished transmission is then sent to Audi.[9] The Aston Martin One-77, Vantage S, V8 Vantage, Aston Martin DB9  and Maserati GranTurismo S use rear transaxle gearboxes while the Maserati Quattroporte and Coup\u00e9 & Spyder Trofeo- GranSport had an MT-AMT (Automated Manual) gearboxes.

            "text": "Gruppo Bertone, commonly known simply as Bertone, was an Italian automobile company, which specialized in car styling, coachbuilding and manufacturing. Bertone styling is distinctive, with most cars having a strong \"family resemblance\" even if they are badged by different manufacturers. Bertone has styled cars for Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Citro\u00ebn, Ferrari, FIAT, Iso, Lancia, Lamborghini, Mercedes-Benz, Opel and Volvo, among others. In addition, the Bertone studio was responsible for two of the later designs of the Lambretta motorscooter. In the late 1980s, Bertone styled the K20 motorcycle helmet for Swiss bicycle and motorcycle helmet manufacturer Kiwi.[citation needed] The company was based in Grugliasco in northern Italy. Gruppo Bertone was founded as Carrozzeria Bertone in 1912 by Giovanni Bertone. Designer Nuccio Bertone took charge of the company after World War II and the company was divided into two units: Carrozzeria for manufacturing and Stile Bertone for styling. Until its bankruptcy in 2014, the company was headed by the widow of Nuccio Bertone, Lilli Bertone. After its bankruptcy, the Bertone name was retained by some of its former employees who continued as a Milan-based design company, Bertone Design. Giovanni Bertone started a carriage manufacturing business in Turin, at the age of 28. Along with three workers, he built horse-drawn vehicles. In the first decades of the 20th century, cars were not common. The road traffic was dominated by horse-drawn carriages and the coaches built by the young Bertone were particularly regarded[by whom?] for their accuracy, quality and solidity. In 1914, Giuseppe Bertone, nicknamed \"Nuccio\", the second son of Giovanni Bertone, was born. This nickname later became known[by whom?] as the signature to Nuccio, one of the greatest Italian style masters in the world. The outbreak of the first world war triggered a major crisis of the young Italian industrial sector and heavily affected Giovanni Bertone, who was forced to close his company. At the end of the First World War, Bertone's business restarted and expanded its activities, and began focusing on the automotive sector. In 1920, a new plant was opened near the Monginevro 119 in Turin. Twenty people were on the payroll. One year later, the first important contract was signed to the company. This was a torpedo styled body based on the SPA 23S chassis. Then, the FIAT \"501 Sport Siluro Corsa,\" the first of a family of models that would characterize the brand in the years to come, was designed. With that, the high-performance sport car was born. During the 1920s, Turin was represented as one of the worldwide centers of excellence of the car industry. Bertone was sitting on the hub of it and formed partnerships with almost all the manufacturers of the day. Giovanni Bertone began doing bodywork on the Fast, Chiribiri, Aurea, SCAT and Diatto chassis. The most important and long-lasting relationships were those with the two biggest Turin manufacturers: FIAT and Lancia. Vincenzo Lancia realised straight away that Giovanni Bertone was an outstanding skilled craftsman with a great future ahead of him. Affectionately nicknaming him \"Bertunot\", he commissioned Bertone to create complete car bodies, above all for the limited series that the companies of the day were not always equipped to manufacture. This was Bertone's first opportunity to carry out limited production of special cars on standard mechanical bases, and was the beginning of a great industrial experience. These are very exciting years for Bertone himself, and also for the evolution of industrial style and design. The car body shapes are slowly but continuously changing, angular shapes begin to fade, wings start to be joined together. Giovanni Bertone produced torpedo and saloon bodies for FIAT and Lancia, and also for Itala, Diatto and SPA. He also worked on commissions for private customers eager for exclusivity. Alongside sports models like the 1928 Ansaldo 6BS, Giovanni Bertone also designed luxury cars like the Fiat 505 limousine and the Itala 51S, both in 1924. He later designed the Lancia Lambda VIII Series in 1928. Despite the fact that the depression of 1929 had brought many Turin carmakers to their knees, Giovanni Bertone's shrewd management allowed the company to carry on creating cars with great appeal. In 1932, Giovanni designed the imposingly elegant Lancia Artena, which was produced until 1936. In 1933; the following year, a corner stone event for the Carrozzeria Bertone occurred. This was that Nuccio Bertone, who was nineteen at the time, officially began working in his father's company. In the same period, Bertone began working on commercial vehicles, and as the business grew, new premises were needed. The company moved to Corso Peschiera 225. Gruppo Bertone now had fifty members of staff. In 1934, Bertone created the Fiat 527S Ardita 2500, a turning point in car design, with some incredible new details such as the stunning front headlights with fairing along the bonnet. With the Ardita a new kind of style was created, destined to take off towards the end of the decade, with FIAT and Lancia models astounding for their day. Examples were the 'six window' FIAT 1500 Aerodinamica, the opulent Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet and the novel Fiat 1500 Torpedo, with structural features that had never been seen before, such as the fold-away hood which stowed away entirely inside the car. With Giovanni's bold innovations and elegant creations, he was highly appreciated by car experts and fans. With the outbreak of the Second World War, the car market experienced a sudden, drastic downturn. Almost all the bodywork manufacturers, including Bertone, reacted to the crisis by turning to military vehicles of various kinds. The company created vehicles such as the Bertone ambulance on a Lancia Artena base. It was a hard time. The demand was scarce. Raw materials and labour was lacking. Military orders where difficult to fulfill. But production did not stop in the Corso Peschiera plant, some luxurious Lancia Aprilia are manufactured as well as the extremely elegant long chassis Fiat 2800 cabriolet, the only one of its kind, built on commission for race driver and motoring journalist Giovanni Lurani Cernuschi. After the war, as the long slow process of reconstruction began in Europe, the big industrial companies gradually scaled up their production levels, and the bodyworks got back to work. During these difficult years, Nuccio Bertone created cars like the Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet and the Fiat 1100 Stanguellini racing car, which were precursors to some of the design trends in the following decade. At the end of the 1940s, Nuccio Bertone turned to racing, at the wheel of a number of different cars, including a Fiat 500 Barchetta, which Nuccio built for himself. At the end of the decade, the meeting with Vittorio Stanguellini led to the creation of a coup\u00e9 with a Fiat 1100 chassis which got a high public appreciation.. The 1950s brought in the first orders from countries other than Italy, in particular from MG and Bristol Cars Limited in 1952. The following year, Nuccio Bertone designed the prototype for the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint, which was presented at the 1954 Turin Motor Show. A production of 1000 was originally planned, but in the end nearly 40,000 vehicles were made between 1954 and 1965. The car ceased production in 1965. The relationship between Bertone and Alfa Romeo reached its creative peak with the Berlinetta Aerodinamica Tecnica (BAT) concept cars which pushed back the boundaries of car design and aerodynamics: the BAT 5 in 1953, the BAT 7 in 1954 and the BAT 9 of 1955. Research into aerodynamics culminated in the production of the Abarth 750 Record in 1956, built on a Fiat 600 chassis and tested on the high-speed track at Monza. This Abarth set an impressive ten world records, including doing 4,000 kilometres (2,500\u00a0mi) at an average of 156.36\u00a0km/h and covering 10,125.26\u00a0km in 72 hours. In 1957, the company expanded to start the production of the NSU Sport Prinz. The factory in Corso Peschiera could not cope with the forecasted production volumes. Construction work began in Grugliasco on the outskirts of Turin, for a new plant which became operative in 1959, with a workforce of 550. At the end of the 1950s, Bertone came up with some sports Berlinetta which were to make history, such as the Giulietta Sprint Speciale, the Aston Martin DB2/4 and the Maserati 3500 GT. The 1960s were the years of the Italian-style GT. Nuccio Bertone came up with five variations on the theme which would always be dear to his heart, in the shape of five extremely racy GT models: the Alfa Romeo 2600 Sprint, in coup\u00e9 and cabriolet versions, two Ferrari 250 GTs, one named 'Wax' after the commissioning client, and the other for his personal use, the Aston Martin DB4 GT 'Jet' and the Maserati 5000 GT. At the same time, two new industrial partnerships were getting under way, with the work on the Simca 1000 Coup\u00e9 and the BMW 3200 CS limited series, as was the important, but unfortunate ASA 1000, better known as the \"Ferrarina\", or \"little Ferrari\" (as the project originated with Enzo Ferrari), which, despite the high expectations of the public, was a commercial failure upon its release[1]. The Iso Rivolta GT 300, the Iso Rivolta GT 340 and the Iso Grifo were also created in the 1960s. Nuccio Bertone designed a prototype cabriolet of the latter and a racing version known as the A3C. The Grifo years were also the years of the Chevrolet Testudo, driven personally by Nuccio Bertone to the Geneva Motor Show in 1963. The following year saw the Alfa Romeo Canguro, followed in 1965 by the Alfa Romeo Giulia GT, the rightful heir of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint. In 1965, Carrozzeria Bertone experienced a major turning-point, with the launch of the Fiat 850 Spider. The commercial success of this model led Nuccio Bertone to increase the company's production capacity to 120 units per day (between 1965 and 1972 nearly 140,000 were produced, the great majority of which were sold in the United States). With the Fiat 850, the company took a giant leap forward in terms of production volumes, from the 13,000 bodies produced in 1966 to nearly 30,000 in 1968, an increase of 40 percent. The end of the 1960s saw the beginning of the partnership with Ferruccio Lamborghini that was destined to make history in the car world. The first vehicle to come out of this was the Lamborghini Miura, which presented at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show, which reinvented the high performance coup\u00e9 design concept. The Miura was followed by the Marzal in 1967 and the Espada in 1968. In the same period, two other coup\u00e9s appeared: the Alfa Romeo Montreal and the Fiat Dino Coup\u00e9, both out in 1967. Astounding, ground-breaking cars, inventing their own language for the design of the future: these were Nuccio Bertone's trademarks. At the Paris Motor Show of 1968, he presented the Carabo concept car, based on an Alfa 33 chassis. By 1970, Bertone had a workforce of 1,500 staff, and the Grugliasco factory covered an area of 267,000 square metres (2,870,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). The partnership with Lamborghini led to the development of the Lamborghini Espada, by 1973 known as the world's fastest four-seater. The design was inspired by an earlier concept, the Jaguar Pirana. After his initial success with the Espada he went on to design the Lamborghini Jarama and the Lamborghini Urraco. With the Stratos Zero prototype, which built on a Lancia Fulvia 1.6 HF base, Bertone came to represent a new point of reference in modern art, as well as on the international car design scene. The Stratos Zero, which was presented at the 1970 Turin Motor Show, evoked a timeless blend of architecture, sculpture and industrial design.[citation needed] The following year, with some of the Zero's styling cues as a starting point, Bertone created the Lancia Stratos Stradale, a compact coup\u00e9 destined mainly for the racing circuit, and which went on to win numerous victories in world rally championships. In 1972, at the age of 88, Giovanni Bertone died. In that year, as a tacit tribute to the company's founder, the Maserati Khamsin and the Fiat X1/9 were released. The latter, foreshadowed by the Runabout concept car, was the heir of the 850 Spider, and went on to enjoy the same runaway commercial success. Based on the Fiat 128 chassis but with a mid-rear-engine layout, the X1/9 was in production from 1972 to 1988, with 160,000 units manufactured. Meanwhile, Nuccio Bertone's prolific drawing board saw a succession of supercars, runabouts and provocative style concepts. These included the 1973 Series 3 version of the Lamborghini Espada, which redesigned the dashboard configuration, the Lamborghini Countach and the Ferrari 308 GT4 of 1973, the Audi 50 and Innocenti Mini 90 of 1974, the Fiat 131 Abarth Rally in 1975, and the prototype Alfa Romeo Navajo in 1976. In the same year, the company began working for Volvo on the 264 TE. The Volvo 262C, which was presented at the 1977 Geneva Motor Show, was entirely manufactured by Bertone, from the assembly of the basic body to the fitting of the mechanical components and the road trials. This procedural turning point had a big role in transforming the company, which was now set to become a car manufacturer in its own right. From the start of the 1980s, the Fiat Ritmo Cabrio and the Fiat X1/9 were produced and sold directly under the Bertone brand, meaning that the company was now responsible not only for production but also for the sales network and after-sales assistance for the two models. In 1982, Nuccio Bertone turned out another important design, the Citro\u00ebn BX. After entering into a joint-venture with Volvo in 1985 the company began production of the Volvo 780, a two-door saloon entirely created by Nuccio Bertone, from the formal design of the model to the full production cycle. A new commercial agreement drawn up with General Motors Europe in 1986 saw production of the Kadett Cabrio handed over to Bertone. The new Pontiac Fiero GT body design was also due to this relationship with the stile Bertone department of the company.[citation needed]  The partnership with Opel continued with the first generation of the Vauxhall Astra Cabrio, and with the Astra Coup\u00e9 and Astra Cabriolet. The end of the 1980s saw the Citro\u00ebn XM, and the Freeclimber off-roader with mechanical components by Daihatsu and BMW engines. Without abandoning its commitment to exploring the new languages of car design, Bertone entered the 1990s with its focus on technological innovations. Capturing the attention of public and experts alike at the 1992 Turin Motor Show was the aggressively futuristic Blitz barchetta, a showcar which featured an electric engine and avant-garde construction solutions. The barchetta had a tubular chassis in special steel integrated with sandwich-structured fiber glass panels, bodywork in composite materials and carbon interiors. In 1993 the Opel Astra Cabrio and the Fiat Punto Cabrio began production, with the entire production cycle for both cars at the Grugliasco factory; assembly of the bodywork, mechanical components integration, paintwork and fittings. A complete production cycle, ending with the final testing process, which is carried out according to the procedures and standards of the commissioning companies. In 1994, continuing the company's research into low environmental-impact vehicles, Bertone presented the Zero Emission Record (ZER), a futuristic reinterpretation of the Abarth 750 Record. Expressly conceived and created to yield the highest performance levels in the electric car sector, the ZER (which has a Cx of 0.11) set the world one-hour-long distance record (199.822\u00a0km), and broke the 300\u00a0km/h barrier, setting the new world speed record for electric cars (with a top speed of 303.977\u00a0km/h). In 1994, Gruppo Bertone became the first manufacturer in Italy to be awarded the ISO 9001 quality certification. Meanwhile, Nuccio Bertone did not turn his back on a past dedicated to bodywork and continued to design working prototypes; the Karisma in 1994, a four-seater berlinetta on a Porsche base, the Kayak in 1995, a coup\u00e9 on a Lancia K base, the Slalom 'coup\u00e9 de chasse' on an Opel Astra Coupe/Cabrio base, and the Fiat Enduro 4x4, a SUV based on a Fiat Brava floorpan. On 26 February 1997, on the evening of the Geneva Motor Show, Nuccio Bertone died, \"one of the greatest coachbuilders of the century, and international Maestro of Italian style\" in the words of Fulvio Cinti, motoring journalist and car historian. His widow, Lilli Bertone, took over management of the company.[citation needed] While in the past, car manufacturers had paid more attention to the engineering of a car than to its design. By the 1990s they had realized the importance of design to their brand's success and were increasingly bringing more of the creative work in house.[citation needed] This even applied to supercar manufacturers, who in the past had been a major client of the Italian design consultancies (carrozzeria). While Chinese and Indian manufacturers provided some work, this too decreased as once they gained confidence and they too established their own in-house design studios. Despite these difficulties, Bertone obtained some specialist manufacturing projects and continued with design consulting. However, by 2009, the worsening financial situation caused Bertone to sell its Grugliasco plant, along with its manufacturing activities to FIAT.[2] Bertone underwent a major restructuring and became a fully integrated service company in the automotive, transportation, and industrial design sectors. By then, Bertone workforce had reduced to roughly 300, mainly engineers and designers, with a capacity of 300,000 engineering hours per year, which allowed it to manage up to four prototype projects per year, from first style drafts to the effective manufacturing of the prototype. The financial turmoil however continued, leading it to sell off some of its treasured collection of concept cars in 2011.[2][3][4] After having ceased trading because of financial difficulties, Bertone on 18 March 2014[3] confirmed that it will be declared bankrupt if a suitable buyer was not found by the end of April.[2] In May 2013 the license rights of the brand were granted by Bertone Cento to Bertone Design,[5] a company established in Milan, led by architect Aldo Cingolani[6] with the aim of a reviving the brand in various fields, such as architecture, industrial design and fashion. Bertone Design also operates in the railway sector. Its most recent projects are the Frecciarossa 1000[7] Trenitalia and the regional train \"Jazz\"[8] produced by Alstom; both will go into service in 2015. Bertone Design claims continuity with the original company.[9] ",

After the ArcelorMittal merger and the takeover of Corus by Tata Steel, the group is currently the world\u2019s eighteenth and Europe's third largest steel producer.[2] Riva Group (consisting of two companies, Riva Acciaio and Ilva) is private-owned and the whole shareholders' equity is held by the Riva family, through the financial institution \"Riva FIRE\" (which stands for \"Finanziaria Industriale Riva Emilio\"). Riva Acciaio was founded in 1954 in Milan by Adriano and Emilio Riva as an iron scrap trading business. In 1957 the first Riva Acciaio mini-mill was built in Caronno Pertusella near Varese. A few years later, this plant became the first steelworks in Italy to use continuous casting, in partnership with steel plant engineer Danieli. In the 1960s and 1970s Riva expanded by means of the acquisition of several small steel producers in Northern Italy and Spain (Siderurgica Sevillana). Starting from the 80s, Riva took part in the privatization process of the ailing European steel industry[3] by making further acquisitions in the main European countries such as Italy (the previously state-owned steelworks Acciaierie di Cornigliano in Genoa), Belgium (Charleroi-Marcinelle plant) and France (Alpa plant in Gargenville).[4] In 1992 it acquired directly from the German Treuhandanstalt two important plants (Brandenburger Elektrostahlwerke and Henningsdorfer Elektrostahlwerke) in the former German Democratic Republic.[5] In 1995 Riva Acciaio purchased ILVA from the Italian government, becoming one of the main European steel producers. Due to the important role played in the privatization of the European steel industry, Emilio Riva was awarded the Grand Cross of Merit by the King of Belgium (2000), the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2002) and the French Legion of Honour (2005).[6] \u00c9tienne Davignon, former European Commissioner and Vice-president of the European Commission, has defined Emilio Riva as \u201cprophet of this dynamic and optimistic vision of private enterprise\u201d, affirming that \u201csteelmaking is not an industry like the others, and the Riva group is not an industrial group like the others\u201d.[7] The Ilva plant in Taranto is the largest steelworks in Europe, equipped with five blast furnaces. Riva Acciaio's headquarters are in Milan, and facilities are located in Northern Italy (Caronno Pertusella, Verona, Sellero, Lesegno). On March 8, 2006 the Court of Cassation convicted Emilio Riva to 18 months granting conditional leniency, with regard to events occurred from December 1997 to November 1998 related to an attempted illegal coercion of some ILVA employees which Emilio Riva had been charged with others.[8] On June 16, 2010 the Court of Cassation declared the extinction because of the statute of limitations of all the violations which Emilio Riva, among others, had been charged with, as to the events occurred from July 2000 to September 2002 related to the supposed violation of anti-pollution regulations in the management of the Ilva factory of Taranto.[9] On January 19, 2009 the Court of Appeal of Genoa declared null and void the first instance\u2019s verdict related to the charge of pollution and declared the extinction because of the statute of limitations of the other minor charges which Emilio Riva and two of his sons had been charged with in the management of the Ilva factory of Genoa, with regard to events occurred from 1995 to 2002 related to the violation of anti-pollution regulations.[10] ",

In the Forbes World's Most Valuable Brands list, Gucci is ranked the 38th most valuable brand, with a brand value of $12.4 billion as of May 2015.[9] As of January 2015, the creative director is Alessandro Michele. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Gucci[10][11][12][13] company became one of the world\u2019s most successful manufacturers of high-end leather goods, clothing, and other fashion products. As an immigrant hotel worker in Paris and later London, young Guccio Gucci (1881\u20131953) was impressed with the luxurious luggage he saw urbane guests bring with them at the Savoy Hotel. Before leaving, he visited the manufacturer, H.J. Cave & Sons. Upon returning to his birthplace of Florence, a city distinguished for high-quality materials and skilled artisans, he established a shop in 1920 that sold fine leather goods with classic styling. Although Gucci organized his workrooms for industrial methods of production, he maintained traditional aspects of fabrication. Initially, Gucci employed skilled workers in basic Florentine leather crafts, attentive to finishing. With expansion, machine stitching was a production method that supported construction. Together with three of his sons, Aldo Gucci (1905\u20131990), Vasco Gucci (1907\u20131975), and Rodolfo Gucci (1912\u20131983), Gucci expanded the company to include stores in Milan and Rome as well as additional shops in Florence. Gucci's stores featured such finely crafted leather accessories as handbags, shoes, and his iconic ornamented loafer as well as silks and knitwear in a signature pattern. The company made handbags of cotton canvas rather than leather during World War II as a result of material shortages. The canvas, however, was distinguished by a signature double-G symbol combined with prominent red and green bands. After the war, the Gucci crest, which showed a shield and armored knight surrounded by a ribbon inscribed with the family name, became synonymous with the city of Florence. Aldo and Rodolfo Gucci further expanded the company's horizons in 1953 by establishing offices in New York City. Film stars and jet-set travelers to Italy during the 1950s and 1960s brought their glamour to Florence, turning Gucci's merchandise into international status symbols. Movie stars posed in Gucci's clothing, accessories, and footwear for lifestyle magazines around the world, contributing to the company\u2019s growing reputation. Gucci's distinctive lines made its products among the most frequently copied in the world in the early 2000s. Pigskin, calf, and imported exotic animal skins were subjected to various methods of fabrication. Waterproof canvas and satin were used for evening bags. Bamboo was first used to make handbag handles by a process of heating and molding in 1947, and purses made with a shoulder strap and snaffle-bit decoration were introduced in 1960. In 1964 Gucci\u2019s lush butterfly pattern was custom-created for silk foulards, followed by equally luxuriant floral patterns. The original Gucci loafer was updated by a distinctive snaffle-bit ornament in 1966, while the \"Rolls-Royce\" luggage set was introduced in 1970. Watches, jewelry, ties, and eyewear were then added to the company's product lines. A particularly iconic touch, introduced in 1964, was the use of the double-G logo for belt buckles and other accessory decorations.[14] The company prospered through the 1970s, but the 1980s were marked by internal family disputes that brought Gucci to the brink of disaster. Rodolfo\u2019s son Maurizio Gucci took over the company\u2019s direction after his father\u2019s death in 1983 and dismissed his uncle Aldo\u2014who eventually served a prison term for tax evasion. Maurizio proved to be an unsuccessful president; he was compelled to sell the family-owned company to Investcorp,[15] a Bahrain-based company, in 1988. Maurizio disposed of his remaining stock in 1993. Maurizio was murdered by a hitman in Milan in 1995, and his former wife, Patrizia Reggiani, was convicted of hiring his killer. Meanwhile, the new investors promoted the American-educated Domenico De Sole from the position of family attorney to president of Gucci America in 1994 and chief executive in 1995. The company had previously brought in Dawn Mello in 1989 as editor and ready-to-wear designer in order to reestablish its reputation. Well aware of Gucci\u2019s tarnished image and the value of its name brand, Mello hired Tom Ford in 1990 to design a ready-to-wear line. He was promoted to the position of creative director in 1994. Before Mello returned to her post as president of the American retailer Bergdorf Goodman, she initiated the return of Gucci\u2019s headquarters from the business center of Milan to Florence, where its craft traditions were rooted. There she and Ford reduced the number of Gucci products from 20,000 to 5,000. Steinunn Sigurdard\u00f3ttir was the Director and Senior Designer for Gucci from 1995 to 2000.[citation needed] There were seventy-six Gucci stores around the world in 1997, along with numerous licensing agreements. Ford was instrumental in the process of decision-making with De Sole when the Gucci Group acquired Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, Bottega Veneta, Boucheron, Sergio Rossi, and, in part-ownership with Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga. By 2001 Ford and De Sole shared the responsibility for major business decisions, while Ford concurrently directed design at Yves Saint Laurent as well as at Gucci. The French conglomerate Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, however, gained ownership of 60 percent of the Gucci Group\u2019s stock in 2003. Women\u2019s Wear Daily then announced the departure of both Domenico De Sole and Tom Ford from the Gucci Group when their contracts expired in April 2004. The last spring collection under the direction of Ford and De Sole was a critical and commercial success. Amid widespread speculation in the fashion press about Ford\u2019s heir, the company announced in March 2004 that he would be replaced by a team of younger designers promoted from the ranks of the company\u2019s staff.[16] In 2005, Frida Giannini was appointed as the creative director for women\u2019s ready-to-wear and accessories, previously joining Gucci in 2002. In 2006, she also became the creative director for men's ready-to-wear and the entire Gucci label.[17] As announced in December 12, 2014, Creative Director Frida Giannini and CEO Patrizio di Marco were to step down from Gucci. Marco Bizzarri was appointed CEO of the brand.[18] In 2017, Bizzarri said, \"Being socially responsible is one of Gucci's core values, and we will continue to strive to do better for the environment and animals,\" and therefore fur would be banned from Gucci collections as of 2018.[19] In August 2018, Gucci launched online operations in New Zealand.[20] After being appointed Gucci's creative director in 2015, Michele reintroduced the company's double-G Marmont logo.[21] A turnaround of the company devised in the late 1980s made Gucci a global contender and a notable fashion label. In October 1995, Gucci went public and had its first initial public offering on the AMEX and NYSE for $22 per share. November 1997 also proved to be a successful year as Gucci acquired a watch license, Severin-Montres, and renamed it Gucci Timepieces. The firm was named \"European Company of the Year 1998\" by the European Business Press Federation for its economic and financial performance, strategic vision as well as management quality.[citation needed] Gucci headquarters are in Florence, other world offices are in Milan, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Japan, and New York. Kering headquarters are in Paris. In 1989, Maurizio managed to persuade Dawn Mello, whose revival of New York's Bergdorf Goodman in the 1970s made her a star in the retail business, to join the newly formed Gucci Group as Executive Vice President and Creative Director Worldwide. At the helm of Gucci America was Domenico De Sole, a former lawyer who helped oversee Maurizio's takeover of ten 1987 and 1989. The last addition to the creative team, which already included designers from Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein, was a young designer named Tom Ford. Raised in Texas and New Mexico, he had been interested in fashion since his early teens but only decided to pursue a career as a designer after dropping out of Parsons School of Design in 1986 as an architecture major. Dawn Mello hired Ford in 1990 at the urging of his partner, writer and editor Richard Buckley. In the early 1990s, Gucci underwent what is now recognized as the poorest time in the company's history. Maurizio riled distributors, Investcorp shareholders, and executives at Gucci America by drastically reining in on the sales of the Gucci Accessories Collection, which in the United States alone generated $110\u00a0million in revenue every year. The company\u2019s new accessories failed to pick up the slack, and for the next three years the company experienced heavy losses and teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Maurizio was a charming man who passionately loved his family's business, but after four years most of the company's senior managers agreed that he was incapable of running the company. His management had had an adverse effect on the desirability of the brand, product quality, and distribution control. He was forced to sell his shares in the company to Investcorp in August 1993. Dawn Mello returned to her job at Bergdorf Goodman less than a year after Maurizio\u2019s departure, and the position of creative director went to Tom Ford, then just 32 years old. Ford had worked for years under the direction of Maurizio and Mello and wanted to take the company\u2019s image in a new direction. De Sole, who had been elevated to President and Chief Executive Officer of Gucci Group NV, realized that if Gucci were to become a profitable company, it would require a new image, and so he agreed to pursue Ford\u2019s vision. In 1998, Guinness World Records cited the Gucci \"Genius Jeans\" as the most expensive pair of jeans in existence. These jeans were distressed, ripped and covered with African beads and were offered for sale for US$3,134 in Milan.[22] (This record was surpassed in June 2005 by Levi Strauss & Co.'s 115-year-old 501 jeans that sold to an anonymous Japanese collector for $60,000.)[23] In early 1999, the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, headed by Bernard Arnault, increased its shareholdings in Gucci with a view to a takeover. Domenico De Sole was incensed by the news and declined Arnault's request for a spot on the board of directors, where he would have access to Gucci\u2019s confidential earnings reports, strategy meetings, and design concepts. De Sole reacted by issuing new shares of stock in an effort to dilute the value of Arnault\u2019s holdings. He also approached French holding company Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) about the possibility of forming a strategic alliance. Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, the company\u2019s founder, agreed to the idea and purchased 37 million shares in the company, or a 40% stake. Arnault\u2019s share was diluted to a paltry 20%, and a legal battle ensued to challenge the legitimacy of the new Gucci-PPR partnership, with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom representing Gucci. Courts in the Netherlands ultimately upheld the PPR deal, as it did not violate that country's business laws. The second largest shareholder is Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais with 11%. As of September\u00a02001[update], a settlement agreement was put into place between Gucci Group, LVMH, and PPR. Following Ford's departure, Gucci Group retained three designers to continue the success of the company's flagship label: John Ray, Alessandra Facchinetti and Frida Giannini, all of whom had worked under Ford's creative direction. Facchinetti was elevated to Creative Director of Women's wear in 2004 and designed for two seasons before leaving the company. Ray served as Creative Director of Menswear for three years. 32-year-old Giannini, who had been responsible for designing men's and women's accessories, served as Creative Director for the entire brand. In 2006, Frida Giannini, formerly Creative Director of accessories, was named sole Creative Director. In 2009, Patrizio di Marco replaced Mark Lee as CEO of Gucci. Marco Bizzarri was appointed CEO of the brand as announced on December 12, 2014,[18] and Alessandro Michele became Gucci's Creative Director on January 21, 2015.[24] In April 2016, Susan Chokachi was promoted to the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Gucci America, having previously held the role of Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications.[25] From 2016, Gucci's Internet presence has grown with more people searching for the brand online.[26] In 2017, the brand saw a 115% increase in growth, with over $61,798,514 earned in media value.[27] Furthermore, the fashion house saw a 44.5% increase in revenues in the nine months ending 30th September 2017. This growth can be linked to the success of their digital marketing strategies, which has allowed the brand to integrate the digital world to the in-store experience, and communicate to a larger target audience.[28] Gucci saw a 130% web traffic increase from 1.8M site visits in January 2017 to 4.2M visits in December 2017.[29] Gucci has focused on the online shopping experience, creating a sense of digital inspiration by including visually rich large images and videos, with information on current fashion collections in the editorial section \"The Agenda\".[30] The company has actively frequently uploaded posts of behind the scenes, with information on the patterns and styles, which highlight the craftsmanship of each product design.[31] This has allowed consumers to gain a stronger emotional relationship with the brand.  Gucci has a strong digital presence online, and is heavily active across various social media platforms with the brand name: Gucci. These include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Pinterest, and Snapchat.[32] In 2017, the brand was seen to be the most-discussed brand on social media within the high-end luxury market.[33] The brand has integrated itself into the modern digital world with campaigns such as the 'collaborative art project'. This campaign was to market a new line of watches, in which the brand collaborated with artists and popular Instagram meme accounts. Memes can be defined as a joke, fad or memorable piece of content that spreads across the web and is usually accompanied by a witty caption. For Gucci, the brand focused on Instagram ads, where they reimagined popular memes with their watch collection, prompting users to share and tag their friends. Despite the conversation and shares, the campaign was not wildly successful, with many viewers reacting negatively to the content.[34] Gucci has created strong partnerships with Hollywood celebrities and social media influencers, working closely with these individuals to reach more demographics and re-establish its identity as a new, modern brand; despite the fact that it has been around for a while.[35] The brand has changed directions in working with the type of celebrities, with Gucci now dressing contemporary style icons like Rihanna, Blake Lively, Brad Pitt, Rachel McAdams, Harry Styles and Salma Hayek, who can be easily resonated with millennials.[36]  Along with this, Gucci has worked closely with internet stars and has transformed many up and coming Instagram users into luxury-brand stars. These collaborations have been proven to be successful due to the associations with opinion leaders who try to influence the purchasing behaviours of opinion seekers, who are actively searching for information to assist with their purchasing behaviours and decisions.[37] As research has found that consumers make purchases based on what they mean and see items as a sense of their extended self, this form of word-of-mouth marketing can be used to influence the brand's meaning and thus, influence the probability of purchases.[38] Gucci has also employed symbols from pop culture in their clothing designs. The Spring 2017 collection featured Donald Duck.[39] Other pop culture icons that have been used by Gucci include Bugs Bunny and the Mitford family. Gucci's Summer 2018 collection featured a collaboration with Sega.[40] The Gucci logo adapted Sega's graphic font.[41] Gucci may be used as an adjective to describe something of a high price or quality, or something that looks beautiful, referencing the brand's high retail costs and fame in the fashion industry, but without any direct suggestion that the item is a Gucci product. The earliest known instance of the word being used in this sense is found in the September 1999 issue of Harper's Bazaar, in which singer Lenny Kravitz describes his bedroom as \"very Gucci.\"[42] In June 2012, Gucci won a trademark lawsuit against Guess with an award of $4.7 million in damages.[43] On 16 October 2013, Gucci won a trademark counterfeiting and cybersquatting lawsuit, in US federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, against several online businesses.[44] Gucci won permanent injunction, the \"immediate surrender to Gucci of 155 domain names used in the counterfeiting operation\", and an award of USD $144.2 million, which includes interest.[44] On 5 November 2013, the UK's Intellectual Property Office issued a ruling that Gucci has lost the rights to its GG trademark in the UK \"to a version of the GG logo in four categories, which encompassed garments such as bracelets, shoulder bags, scarves and coats\".[45] German clothing firm Gerry Weber applied to revoke \"the trademark on account of its 'nonuse' in the periods from 2003 through 2008 and 2007 through 2012\".[45] However, \"according to Gucci, the ruling does not affect the use of its GG logo in the region\" because \u201cGucci is the owner of several other valid registrations for this mark, including a Community Trade Mark (covering the European Union) for its iconic GG logo and those rights are directly enforceable in the U.K.\"[45] On 6 November 2013, Gucci won a trademark infringement and unfair competition activities lawsuit against Guess in Nanjing Intermediate People\u2019s Court of the People's Republic of China.[43] Gucci claimed that Guess was \" imitating its collections and image.\"[43] In December 2014, a Gucci subcontractor in Italy told Investigative Journalists that Gucci was aware it irregularly employed Chinese workers who worked as long as 14 hours a day.[46] Gucci produced controversial advertisements that many believe sexualizes and objectifies women. Erving Goffman conducted research on advertisements and how they are consistently reinforcing common stereotypes of women.[47] He outlined different characteristics commonly found in media that tend to favor men over women. These stereotypes, which can all be found in Gucci\u2019s advertisements, include relative size, ritualization of subordination, feminine touch, and function ranking.[48] Almost all of Gucci\u2019s advertisements include a woman who is being dismembered to show off a certain part of her body, positioned in a way, that some would consider, sexualizes her body, or made much smaller in size to appear submissive to the counterpart (usually a male) in the ad. Jean Kilbourne describes how often advertisements are working to undermine women and place women in positions of passivity.[48] Many people find these advertisements offensive and in turn many organizations have publicly criticized Gucci. The Fashion Law, a fashion legal and business website, argues that the infamous line \u201csex sells\u201d is proven through Gucci\u2019s continual use of scandalous advertisements and correlating sales.[49] In early 2003 Gucci produced a highly popular advertisement which pictured a supermodel with her pants pulled down and her pubic hair shaved into a \"G\". The Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) received countless complaints from people and organizations, including the director of mediawatchuk demanding the ad be banned due to his belief it was \"harmful to society\".[50] Many believed that the outcry regarding the ad just fed the idea that Gucci was using sex to successfully sell their products.[49] Although this was a point of contention between Gucci and the Advertising Standards Authority, scholars have shown that Gucci continues to walk the thin line between offensive and acceptable advertisements.[citation needed] The Italian luxury brand still continues to publish controversial ads. Gucci used a short film and images with reference to a cult film about drug addiction. This advertisement received a lot of backlash primarily because one of their young models was unhealthily thin according to the Advertising Standards Authority.[51] This advertisement sounded shocking to many, but to the advertisement industry it was regarded as a prime example of what companies are supposed to do.[52] William O'Barr argues that advertisements' main priority is to break through and draw the consumer's attention, regardless of what is deemed appropriate in society's eyes.[53] In February 2019, Gucci advertised a black turtleneck sweater, which included a partial balaclava with red lips, which many twitter users criticized as resembling blackface. The brand quickly addressed the controversy by issuing an apology statement and asserting that the piece was \"immediately removed\" from its online and physical stores.[54][55] Rapper and actor 50 Cent posted a video on Instagram of himself burning a Gucci t-shirt in response to this incident, captioning the video \"I gotta get rid of all the Gucci I have at home. I'm not supporting their brand anymore.\" [56] Aldo Gucci expanded into new markets including an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC). The automaker merged the worlds of couture and automobiles with the Gucci version of the AMC Hornet.[57] Starting in October 1971,[58] the 1972 and 1973 model year Hornet compact \"Sportabout\" station wagons became one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a famous fashion designer.[59] Although coming from Italy where sleek sports cars are more revered, Gucci put his special touch efforts on the Hornet station wagon with a rear lift gate and 60.8 cubic feet (1,722\u00a0l) of cargo space inside.[60] In contrast to ordinary boxy-looking station wagons, the Sportabout's design featured a low sloping roofline in the rear and tight overall dimensions.[61] The Gucci versions came with the designer's signature red and green trim colors on well-padded beige-upholstered seating and on the interior door panels. The Gucci crest appeared on the inside front door panels and on the front fenders, while the \"GG\" trademark was on the headliner. Exterior color selections were limited to Snow White, Hunter Green, Grasshopper Green, and Yuca Tan.[62] The $142 Gucci trim option package was selected on a total of 2,584 Sportabouts produced during 1972 and on 2,251 more during the 1973 model year.[63] Additionally, a Sportabout was commissioned by Gucci for his personal use and to showcase some of his other automotive ideas.[61] The exterior grille featured a Gucci motif, transparent covers over the front lights wrapped around the sides, and the rear trim panel had horizontal red and green stripes on a gray cloth insert.[61] The interior was finished in black leather and a tight-weave Italian fabric incorporating the double-G pattern in black against a light gray background and gray carpeting with black piping. Front bucket seats featured center armrest with vanity case and the dashboard had pullout writing desk with folding lamp, notepad, pen and vanity mirror on a flexible holder.[61] Rear seat passengers had a center fold-down armrest with a set of games in a removable box and the right seat back included a foldout table for snacking or playing with the game set and the left seatback opened to a compartment housing four tumblers and two beverage bottles.[61] Starting in 1978 and producing a decreasing number each year through the 1984 model year, a Miami-based coachbuilder marketed a Gucci edition of the Cadillac Seville sedan.[63] The exterior included a \"facing double G\" Gucci logo, an emblem actually featuring Guccio Gucci\u2019s initials,[14] as a hood ornament and the c-pillar covered vinyl roof. The interior had a headliner of the logo and headrests adorned with the logo as well. The dashboard carried the \"Gucci script\" logo in bold lettering. Inside the trunk was a full set of Gucci luggage. For 2011, Gucci and Fiat unveiled special versions of the Fiat 500 featuring characteristic stripes inside on the seat belts, seat upholstery, shifter, floor mats, and key fob.[64] The exterior includes green and red stripes below the window line and wrapping around the back as well as 16-inch wheels with Gucci\u2019s interlocking-G logo on the center caps.[65] Available in white with matte-finish chrome trim or in black with glossy chrome accents, the small car includes leather trim and other designs \"to make it feel like a Gucci handbag.\"[66] The hatchbacks were joined by the 500C by Gucci featuring a sliding cloth roof with a green-red-green Gucci stripe.[67] The Gucci versions of both the regular 500 and the cloth-top 500C were again available in 2013.[68] Gucci has had a partnership with UNICEF since 2005.[69] Gucci stores worldwide donate a percentage of the sales for special collections made specifically for UNICEF to go toward the United Nations Children's Fund. The annual Gucci Campaign to Benefit UNICEF supports education, healthcare, protection and clean water programs for orphans and children affected by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. For the campaign in 2009, Michael Roberts promoted a children's book, \"Snowman in Africa\" with proceeds going to UNICEF. In five years, Gucci donated over $7\u00a0million to UNICEF. Gucci is the largest corporate donor to UNICEF's \"Schools for Africa\" that was established in 2004 by UNICEF, the Nelson Mandela Foundation, and the Hamburg Society. Its goal is to increase access to basic schooling for all, with a special emphasis on children orphaned by HIV/AIDS and children living in extreme poverty. Launched in February 2013, the \"Chime for Change\" campaign[70] works to further the global campaign for girls' and women's empowerment. Gucci has funded over 210 projects in 81 countries through this initiative. In 2013, it was announced that Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles would work with Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini on the campaign that aims to spread female empowerment. The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to new music by Knowles.[71] A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London[72] and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Laura Pausini, Florence and the Machine, Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora.[73] The concert raised over $130,000. In July 2013, activist Lydia Emily was commissioned to paint a mural on Skid Row, Los Angeles of a woman named Jessica, who is a survivor of human trafficking. She currently works for the Mary Magdalene Project\u2014an organization which has been helping women leave the sex industry since 1980.[74] Gucci opened a 1,715-square-metre (18,460\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) museum charting its 90-year history; Gucci Museo is located in Florence, within the Palazzo della Mercanzia and overlooking the Piazza della Signoria.[75]  ",

In the following years, teams such as Fiorella Citroen, Magniflex Fam Cucine, Santini Selle Italia, Alfa Lum cycling team, and Dromedario Sidermec road Guerciotti bikes. During this period, the Magniflex Fam Cucine team won 5 stages in the 1979 Giro d'Italia, and finished 3rd overall with Bernt Johansson.[2] In 1977, Paolo Guerciotti founded the GS Guerciotti cyclocross team. This team would go on to enjoy incredible success, winning two professional and seven amateur world championships.[3] In 1984, Antonio Mondonico became a partner and supervised the production of about 2,000 frames a year. However, the partnership with Mondonico ended in 1989.[4] Guerciotti continues to produce bicycles in the traditional manner using steel, carbon fibre and aluminium.  ",

Gufram was born in 1966 as a brand of the creative lab for modern furniture production of the Fratelli Gugliermetto, active seat and chairs makers since 1952, in Grosso, Torino. Influenced in the early '60s avant-garde artistic culture in Torino and the radical architectural experimentation of those years, the Gugliermetto brothers began to study with the support of emerging artists and architects of the time new forms and new materials to use in the production of design projects. The usage of polyurethane as insulating material in the transportation industry around 1970, and the definition of the system of cold pressing of it, allowed Gufram to start producing durable seating revolutionary aesthetics, which tightens the eye to Pop Art, structured padded with polyurethane foam. Since 1965, Gufram follows the artistic direction of Giuseppe Raimondi (designer), who signs for different products, and helps the company to involve other artists and architects in the design, and planning of the early products and prototypes of the company. In 1968, Gufram presents its products under the name of Multipli (industrially reproduced art objects in limited edition) in the XIV Triennale in Milan, enjoying a considerable success with the public and press that encouraged the company to go further with their philosophy and production method explored up to that moment.  International consecration takes place in 1972, with an exhibition dedicated to Italian design entitled \"Italy: The New Domestic landscape\" curated by Emilio Ambasz staged at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York, where they are first exposed,[2] and subsequently acquired different Multipli for the museum's permanent collection.[3][4] From that moment on, Gufram products officially entered into the history of design and in the main collection of recognized European and American museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art[5] of New York, the Vitra Design Museum, the permanent collection the Triennale of Milan, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Art Museum of Denver in the USA. Over 30 years, Gufram implements its catalog of products with new collaborations while maintaining its headquarters in Piedmont until 2005, when the property is sold to the Poltrona Frau Group, which manages the brand until the end of 2011. Since the last months of 2011, after being purchased by entrepreneurs in the sector who wish to contribute to the revitalization of a historic brand of Italian design, the brand returns to Piedmont, settling in the new headquarters of Barolo, Piedmont. The Gufram catalogue consists in a number of limited edition pieces (Multipli) and open. The main products are: Part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.[6] Part of the collection of MOMA, the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[7] Part of the collection of MOMA, the Museum of Modern Art in New York.[8] Part of the collection of Triennale Design Museum in Milan.[9] ",

Hera operates in the distribution of gas, water, energy, and waste disposal in the provinces of Bologna, Ferrara, Forl\u00ec-Cesena, Modena, Ravenna, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, and in some municipalities of Florence and Ancona. In October 2012, Hera approved the merger with AcegasAps Group, which operates in the cities of Padua  and Trieste. On 1 July 2014 AMGA, which operates in Udine merged with Hera Group. In 2014, Hera was the number one Italian domestic operator in terms of the amount of waste treated (over 6.4 million tons), in second place for the integrated water cycle (294 million m\u00b3), the third larger player in gas distribution (2.6 billion cm) and fourth in the Italian Electricity business in terms of electricity sold (9.1 TWh). Hera was established in 2002[4] through the first merger of public utilities in the Emilia-Romagna region, which involved 11 companies. In 2003, Hera started the process of listing on the Milan Stock Exchange,[5] which led the company to be partly privatized with 38.8% of its present share capital in private sectors. After 2003, Hera started to grow. In over five years, the Group merged with other Italian companies operating in distribution of energy, water and gas, such as Agea, Ecosea, Meta, Geat Distribution Gas, and Sat Inc. Hera also had many long-term contracts with foreign suppliers over the years that followed. In 2006, Hera signed a memorandum of understanding with Enel, Edison and Sonatrach. The memorandum provided for the purchase of one billion cubic meters a year of natural gas transported through the methane pipeline belonging to Galsi, a partner company of Hera. In July 2008, Hera acquired Megas Trade, selling gas and electricity in the Urbino area, owned by Marche Multiservices. The transaction formalized the birth of Hera Comm Marche, the commercial branch of the Hera Group for the Marche region, managed by Hera Comm. On 25 July 2012, approval was given for the merger with Acegas-Aps S.p.A.[6] (Trieste-Padua), which became part of the Hera Group as of 1 January 2013. On 1 July 2014 AMGA \u2013 Azienda Multiservizi S.p.A. merged with Hera Group. Strategies and activities are mainly carried out by the Holding, which has a leading and coordinating role throughout its seven Divisions: Environment, Services, Sales and Marketing, Fluids Distribution, Large Plants Engineering and Electricity Distribution, and District Heating. Hera Comm is the trading company of Hera Group, operating in the electricity and gas market throughout Italy. Hera Comm Mediterranea operates exclusively in Southern Italy; Hera Comm Marche, located in Urbino, is the commercial branch of the Hera Group in the Marche region. Hera has a wide shareholding structure. The structure includes over 118 public institutions, over 700 professional investors, and over 19.000 private shareholders. The results in terms of EBITDA and net profit achieved by the Hera Group since its establishment have registered continuous growth over the years. Hera follows a dividend distribution policy that rewards Group shareholders; the Municipalities, are the main beneficiaries of Hera\u2019s dividend policy. Shareholder Base as at 7 November 2017:[7] The Hera Group operates in the public utility services sector, pursuing a sustainable management policy. The Group\u2019s main activities are: management of waste services (waste collection and disposal, waste-to-energy and composting), water services (treatment, purification, sewerage) and energy services (distribution and sale of methane gas and electricity, district heating). Hera Group EBITDA composition (as at 31 December 2014):[8] Hera has the largest number of waste treatment plants in Italy. The environmental hygiene services provided by Hera Group in 198 municipalities in Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche, Tuscany and Veneto are part of an integrated waste management system. Activities include separated urban waste collection, washing and cleaning roads, pavements and porticos, cleaning up green areas and complementary services such as the reclamation of degraded areas and cleaning up beaches.The high percentage of separate waste collection and disposal in the reference areas makes the Group a major national operator in the field of environmental services: Hera Group is one of the largest Italian operators in integrated water service management. With a total network of over 53 thousand km and approximately 1,400 production plants (such as wells), treatment plants and purification plants, 3.6 million citizens receive catchment, treatment, distribution, sewerage and purification services: Hera is also a major national operator in gas and electricity sectors. Managing networks spanning 20 thousand km, Hera Group distributes natural gas in the provinces of Bologna, Ravenna, Forl\u00ec-Cesena, Ferrara, Modena, Rimini, Florence, Padua, Trieste, Gorizia and Udine. Through its subsidiary Marche Multiservizi, it also has a presence in the province of Pesaro-Urbino.  In Bologna, Imola, Forl\u00ec, Cesena, Ferrara, Modena, Ravenna and Padua, the Group also offers district heating services, providing heat to buildings located far away from the point of production. With networks spanning 460\u00a0km, Hera serves around 82 thousand apartments. In 2013, its environmentally-friendly technology enabled it to achieve a primary energy saving of more than 34 thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Hera also oversees the distribution of electricity through 12 thousand km of grids in 26 municipalities in the provinces of Modena, Bologna, Ravenna, Gorizia and Trieste, serving a total of around 623 thousand inhabitants. The Group\u2019s main commitment in this sector is to the implementation of smart grids and the distribution of digital meters. These are designed to ensure the rapid and remote management and exchange of an enormous volume of information about effective electricity consumption between producer, distributor and consumer. Hera Group can be compared to the other listed Italian multi-utilities. Comparison on operating data by business (waste, water, gas and electricity) also highlights the market shares.

(HRI) is a rail transport engineering company based in Italy whose main products are the design and manufacturing of railway and mass transit vehicles.  Formerly AnsaldoBreda S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, the company was sold in 2015 to Hitachi Rail along with the 40% share of Ansaldo STS that Finmeccanica owned.[2] After the deal was finalized, the current name was adapted in November 2015 to reflect the new ownership.[3] In 1853, the company Gio. Ansaldo & C. was registered in Genoa as a manufacturer of steam locomotives, rail rolling stock and steam engines. The company was supported by the Minister of Finance, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, who aimed to reduce the State of Savoy's dependence on imported trains and rolling stock.[4] Ansaldo entered the age of the steam locomotive in 1854 with its model FS113, also known as Sampierdarena. In 1886, Ernesto Breda founded Ing. Ernesto Breda and C.,[5] the company which became Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda (SIEB) in 1899. In 1908 SIEB's thousandth locomotive was built, a model FS 685 with serial number 600[5] now preserved in the Leonardo da Vinci Museum of Science and Technology in Milan. It used Caprotti valve gear.[6] Breda (SIEB) entered the electric locomotive era in 1936 with the production of the FS Class ETR 200 series electric multiple unit.  In 1939 this type set the land speed record for rail vehicles[7] at 203\u00a0km/h (126\u00a0mph).[8]  Although only 18 trains of this type were constructed they remained in service for a long time until they were finally withdrawn from service in 1993. In 1976 the FS ETR 400 entered service.  Fiat Ferroviaria manufactured the body and bogies, whilst Ansaldo produced the power unit.  It was the first train in the world featuring active body tilting to enter commercial service and was capable of speeds of up to 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph). AnsaldoBreda was formed in 2001 by the merger of Ansaldo Trasporti and Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie,[9] and was part of the Finmeccanica group.[10] It has production sites at four locations in Italy: Naples, Reggio Calabria, Palermo, and Pistoia. The TREVI Consortium, of which Ansaldo and Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie were members, introduced the high speed FS ETR 500 series in 1989.[citation needed] AnsaldoBreda won the contract for 82 new IC4 trains for the Danish national operator DSB.  However, the introduction of the units was plagued by problems, whilst the trains were scheduled to come into service in 2003, the final unit was delivered in 2013.[11] Following more train failures, DSB announced the fleet would be phased out from 2024.[12] The first high-speed trains to run on Turkish rails were two ETR 500 train sets leased from Trenitalia of Italy and were used for testing the completed part of the high-speed railway network between Eski\u015fehir and Ankara on April 23, 2007.[13]  During the tests, ETR 500 Y2 achieved the current rail speed record in Turkey, reaching 303\u00a0km/h.[14]  The train was capable of exceeding 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).  It reached  362\u00a0km/h (225\u00a0mph) in the Monte Bibele tunnel between Florence and Bologna in 2009, setting a speed record for trains in a tunnel.[15] Another high speed train Frecciarossa 1000 high speed train was developed in a consortium with Bombardier Transportation.[16][17] The first ETR1000 was christened Mennea in honour of the Italian athlete Pietro Mennea[18] who had died five days earlier.  Besides the construction of locomotives, AnsaldoBreda manufactures railway cars, trams, and trains for commuter rail, high-speed rail, and main lines.[19] Finmeccanica and Hitachi announced on 2 November 2015 the 'closing of transactions' covering the acquisition by Hitachi of AnsaldoBreda and Finmeccanica's 40% stake in Ansaldo STS. Under the agreements signed on 24 February 2015, following a dividend distribution announced on 6 March, the purchase price for Finmeccanica's stake in Ansaldo STS has been set at \u20ac9.50 per share, amounting to a total of \u20ac761m.  The total net consideration to be paid for AnsaldoBreda as a going concern, including property assets, amounts to around \u20ac30m.  As a part of the deal Finmeccanica would keep the responsibility for some residual contracts.[20] On 2 November 2015 AnsaldoBreda was sold and changed its name to Hitachi Rail Italy.[3][21][22][23][24] Since acquired by Hitachi, production of some British Rail Class 802 has been shifted to Hitachi Rail Italy's Pistoia plant due to Hitachi Rail's Newton Aycliffe, England plant being at capacity.[25] In 1991, 100 4000 Series from AnsaldoBreda (who also worked on the 2/3000s) were delivered to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. These railcars were delivered with aging DC propulsion and analog doors. These railcars were very similar to the 2000s and 3000s before the 2/3Ks were refurbished by Alstom in Hornell, New York. These cars, which were not very reliable in the first place, were never rehabilitated. (Rehab was supposed to bring them to the same spec as the 7000 series railcards in 2014.) Instead, they were replaced (along with Rohr 1000 Series railcars by 7000 Series railcars from Kawasaki Heavy Industries) on June 24, 2017. On July 4th, 2010, after several incidents where the doors would open while the train was in motion, (a situation that WMATA techs could replicate in a rail yard) WMATA removed the fleet for repairs until July 20th of the same year. On November 17, 2016, Metro discovered an error in which a 4000-series car would display an incorrect speed limit to a train operator while in manual mode (which is the only mode being used since the 2009 Red Line collision). All 4000-series cars were taken out of service in the afternoon, but were returned to service in the middle of trainsets. The cars were retired from the Metrorail system in 2017. In May 2019, after reports of door malfunctions on some 3000 series trains, the entire legacy (non-7000s) fleet was inspected overnight to make sure it wouldn't happen again. Delivery of 83 IC4 trainsets for the Danish State Railways DSB was originally planned for 2003-2006. A primary settlement was reached in May 2009. Danish State Railways shall receive the uncompleted trains from AnsaldoBreda, complete the trains itself, and shall certify the trains for public usage itself. AnsaldoBreda will pay back 2.25 billion DKK (300 million Euro).[61] On 2 July 2012, the DSB announced that the Transportation Authority had approved Denmark's railway operator to put back into operation the fleet of 37 IC4s which had been withdrawn from service in November 2011.[62] In December 2011, it was reported that one of the missing IC4 trainsets planned for delivery in Denmark was found in Libya.[63] Reportedly, AnsaldoBreda and then-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gave Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi the trainset as a present on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Gaddafi's revolution in 2009.[64][65] A secondary settlement was reached on 18 December 2012 between AnsaldoBreda and Danish railways. AnsaldoBreda would pay 98 million Euro, provide additional spare parts and upgrade the train control and management system.[citation needed] The IC4 trains have seen many technical problems during their service. A brake failure caused a collision although the train drove at 30\u00a0km/hour over a distance of 121,5 meters.[66] Smoke required that passengers be evacuated.[67] High levels of noise in the cabins meant that modifications had to be made to all delivered trains. Recordings can be heard here. Faulty and incomplete Train Control and Management System (TCMS software) has caused researchers to deem the train unfit for service.[68] Among other things; cracks in axles, faulty sensors and a faulty generator which necessitated an evacuation. A 2014-report by Swiss firm Prose describes severe problems with the engines in the IC4 trains.[69] DSB announced in 2016 that the trains would be withdrawn from service from 2024.[12][70] V250 train units were delivered to NS over five years later than originally contracted. Soon after the trains went into service in the Netherlands and Belgium, the V250 suffered a number of technical problems. When the first snow fell in the winter of 2012/13, some V250 trains started losing parts of their bottom plates due to ice build-up. Consequently, the Belgian railway company NMBS/SNCB declared the V250 unsafe, and the trains were taken out of commercial service on 16 January 2013.[71] Dutch railways subsequently was seeking compensation for damages[72] and Dutch politicians have called for a parliamentary inquiry into the problems with the V250 train quality issues and AnsaldoBreda's failure to rectify them in a timely manner. On 22 January Belgian railways called on AnsaldoBreda to fix all deficiencies that had been independently identified with the V250 units within 3 months, as agreed in the purchase contract, or the contract would be declared void.[73] In May 2013, the Belgian railway company cancelled its contract with AnsaldoBreda, after a technical examination of a pair of V250 train halves. The inspections yielded 1159 and 2019 deficiency points, where a total of 9 per full train was the permitted tolerance before rejection. The report mentioned, amongst others, the following defects:[74][75] during a test run, an iron plate of the roof bent towards the overhead wire, axles were severely rusted, with a risk of breaking in moving trains,[76] the brakes were not suited for high-speed trains, wiring was not shielded from rain and snow, a bottom plate came loose and fell down on the railtrack, batteries overheated in carriages that had been already taken out of service, resulting in fire and subsequent scorches in the carriages, earthing points were wrongly connected, causing electric driven heavy oxidation, the door sliding mechanisms were faulty, assembly varied from train to train. On the same day the report was published, the Belgian public broadcasting organizations RTBF and VRT got hold of photographs showing the wrecked conditions the V250 trains were in.[77][78] However, because of major technical problems with these trains, the trains were taken out of rotation within weeks after the start of the service. On the 31st of May 2013, the NMBS/SNCB cancelled the Fyra project entirely.[79][80] On June 3, NS also announced it was stopping operation of V250 trains. According to their survey of the trains it would take at least 17 months to repair all construction flaws, and entry into service would not be expected before 2018.[81] In addition, even if trains were to be repaired, the maintenance cost would be much higher and the lifetime of the trains much lower than agreed in the contracts with AnsaldoBreda. It is currently unlikely that the V250 will enter commercial service again. In a response to the Dutch and Belgian complaints about damage to the trains, AnsaldoBreda blamed the operators for being irresponsible in running the trains at the certified top speed of 250\u00a0km/h in winter,[82] and not performing the recommended daily maintenance.[83] Belgian rail operators claim the latter is not true, and that the problems encountered can only be caused by structural problems with the trains.[84] On March 17, 2014 NS announced a settlement with AnsaldoBreda had been reached. The 9 NS trains will be returned to AnsaldoBreda for a refund of 125 Million Euro, 88 Million Euro less than originally paid. NS will receive an additional compensation for each resold unit to a maximum of 21 Million Euro.[85] The City of Gothenburg in Sweden has ordered 40 one-directional Sirio trams which were to be put into service on the Gothenburg tram network during 2005 and onwards.  The trams were delivered late and functioned poorly when put into traffic. Among reported problems were excessive track damage caused by the trams, malfunctioning airconditioners inside the trams and poor ride quality. The City of Gothenburg therefore withheld a large part of the payment for a delivered tram until fully operational.[86] On December 3, 2009, the city authorities exercised their option for a further 25 trams of the same design at a cost of \u20ac61m.[87] In February 2013, 38 out of the total 40 trams delivered in the first series were taken out of service due to extensive corrosion on the chassis.[88]  Repairing the rusted chassis and moldy passenger floors is expected to be completed by 2017,[89] at a cost for Gothenburg council of an extra \u20ac10m according to the revised contract, although AnsaldoBreda bears the majority of the cost for these deficiencies.[citation needed] Of the 65 trams purchased, only about 35-40 are usable.[48] Due to further delays on the part of Ansaldobreda with the corrosion repairs and substandard quality in completed works, the council of Gothenburg cancelled the contract for corrosion repairs in November 2015.[48] None of the three repaired trams that AnsaldoBreda delivered was in working order and might actually be scrapped. The investigation launched into the matter found that the trams were jerry-built and that AnsaldoBreda did not have the will, nor the competence to do anything about the problems.[49] It was also discovered that the badly built trams have resulted in extensive track damage that will be very costly to repair, adding to the \"fiasco\" of the Gothenburg AnsaldoBreda tram affaire.[50] After the problems had been publicised in Swedish media, AnsaldoBreda chairman Antonio Liguori sent a letter to Gothenburg Municipality which contained threats of concerted actions with other companies against the municipality, along with demands of 10 million euro.[90] The 31 August the tribunal closed the arbitration see https://www.gp.se/nyheter/g%C3%B6teborg/klart-120-miljoner-f%C3%B6r-skandalvagnar-1.4592121 The 32 two-directional trams delivered for Oslo from 1999, called SL95, have met several difficulties with rust during snowy weather and the heavy weight requires a lot of maintenance to streets and tracks, which make the trams expensive to operate.[91][92] They are also considered to create more noise than necessary. The replacement of the trams will start in 2020 and the last trams will be taken out of service in 2024.[93][94]  Media related to AnsaldoBreda at Wikimedia Commons ",

            "text": "Illycaff\u00e8 S.p.A. (branded as illy) is an Italian coffee roasting company that specializes in the production of espresso. The company was founded by Francesco Illy in 1933, and it was later led and expanded by his son, Ernesto Illy. Today, Andrea Illy is the Chairman, representing the third generation of family leadership, and Massimiliano Pogliani is the CEO. As of 31 December 2015, the company had 1,177 employees, 8.6% more than 2014. The company's coffee is present in 140 countries, and at the end of 2016, its revenues totaled \u20ac460 million, a 5% increase over 2015.[1] The company produces one blend in three roast variations, those being normal, dark roast, and decaffeinated. In addition, illy offers Monoarabica, single-origin arabica beans from six different countries: Brazil, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Colombia, Costa Rica, and India. Seasonally, the company offers Idillyum, a low-caffeine arabica that is grown in the rich, volcanic soils of El Salvador. The illy brand of coffee is packaged as whole beans, pre-ground coffee, Easy Serving Espresso (E.S.E.) pods, and iperEspresso capsules. The history of illycaff\u00e8 is inextricably linked to the lives of the company's founder, Francesco Illy (known as Illy Ferenc in Hungarian), and his family. Born in Temesv\u00e1r in the Empire of Austria-Hungary (since 1918 Timi\u015foara, Romania), Francesco Illy later went to Trieste, Italy, during World War I as an officer in the army. After the war, he remained in the city, which had recently come under Italian rule, and in 1933 set up a business in the cocoa and coffee sectors, eventually deciding to concentrate exclusively on coffee.[2] From the beginning, Francesco was interested in espresso coffee. In 1935, he invented the first automatic coffee machine which substituted compressed air for steam: the illetta, the predecessor of today's espresso machines.[3] Francesco also devised a new packaging system for preserving coffee, in which the cans were filled with an inert gas instead of air pressurization. Illy coffee was soon \"exported\" outside the immediate Trieste area, and it was eventually sold all over Italy. After World War II, control of the company passed to Ernesto Illy (1925\u20132008), the son of the founder, who started a research laboratory that soon became the source of numerous new inventions and patents. It was Ernesto, a scientist and researcher, who established cooperation agreements with universities and research centres, and he promoted premium coffee around the globe.[4] Ernesto's son Andrea Illy is currently the Chairman of the company, while Andrea's sister Anna Illy and brothers Francesco Illy and Riccardo Illy are on the board of directors.[2] The illy brand of coffee is available in many countries, though with significant price differences depending on import duty rates. Illycaff\u00e8 S.p.A. established the University of Coffee in Naples in 1999[5]. The mission is to spread all over the world the knowledge of coffee through education, research and innovation[6]. The University was later moved to the city of Trieste, in the company's offices. The University of Coffee's network consists of 27 branches around the world[7]. Currently, illycaff\u00e8 S.p.A. is a large international company, selling its coffee-related products in approximately 140 countries worldwide. The illy group is made up of several companies located in North America, France, Germany, Spain and Benelux. The group employs approximately 800 people throughout these six locations. Since the end of the 1980s, illy has not purchased green coffee from the international commodity markets, but directly from the source. The company exclusively purchases coffee of the arabica species, in particular from Brazil, the largest producer worldwide, but also from Colombia, India, and countries in Africa and Central America. Illy's Universit\u00e0 del caff\u00e8 (\"University of Coffee\") offers free training for growers. In Brazil, a nine-month program (one week per month) includes 360 hours of lectures. Illy buys between 10% and 30% of coffee produced by growers trained at the University of Coffee at a premium price, but does not require that the growers enter into an exclusive contract with the company.[8] Illy is the world's first company to receive the Responsible Supply Chain Process (RSCP) certification of sustainability awarded by the Det Norske Veritas (DNV).[9] From 2004 to 2012, illycaff\u00e8 funded the Ernesto Illy Trieste Science Prize to give recognition to science researchers from the developing world, in collaboration with The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS).[10] Illy was featured in the 2006 documentary Black Gold, in reference to its marketing of coffee from Ethiopia. Illy coffees are blended from arabica beans from multiple sources. The grounds are packaged in steel canisters and pressurized with an inert gas rather than air.  On 22 May 2009, in partnership with The Coca-Cola Company, illy launched a line of coffee-flavoured energy drinks called illy issimo. On 9 November 2009, AirTran Airways became the first small regional airline to serve illy issimo to passengers on board flights. Illy issimo was available in five flavours as of 16 May 2011: caff\u00e8, caff\u00e8 no sugar, cappuccino, latte macchiato, and mochaccino.[11]  ",

S.p.A. was founded in 1910 by Gino Pizzarotti and converted in 1945 into a limited liability company by Pietro Pizzarotti, father of the current Chairman, Cav. Lav. Paolo Pizzarotti. In 1961 it became a joint stock company with a share capital of 200 million euros, more recently increased to 300 million. It was from the end of the 1950s that the company consolidated its position in the construction sector, becoming one of the most important and skilled companies in the country; this came about through the completion of large public and infrastructure works on behalf of both state bodies and the largest private companies in Italy. The company TEMPhas always targeted ongoing development in the civil works carried out for thermo-electrical and nuclear power stations, roads and motorways, civil and military airports, irrigation and hydraulic engineering works, dykes, industrial infrastructure, railway construction, and prison construction work; the same can be said of the reconstruction work in the areas struck by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, where it was involved in the building of dwellings, schools, and infrastructure of various kinds. Teh Pizzarotti Group, which TEMPhas always retained its head office in Parma, today consists of a number of companies operating in total synergy in the infrastructure, energy and environment, hydraulic engineering, civil and military airport, building, construction and real estate main sectors.weawdasd Mipien S.p.A. is the holding company of Impresa Pizzarotti & C. S.p.A. and holds 96,77% of its shares. It is a service company for the companies of the Group and holds investments strategic to the Group's activity. As of December 31, 2014, Mipien S.p.A revenues summed to 1.14 billion euros, wif a gross operating margin of 141,6 million euros and a gross ebidta of 12,4%.[2] Impresa Pizzarotti & C. S.p.A is amongst the leading Italian and European construction sector companies operating in the design and construction of major civil and infrastructure works, such as buildings, hospitals, roads and motorways, rail works and underground works. Transport infrastructure (roads, motorways, railways, underground railways, airports and ports) are Pizzarotti Group's primary area of activity, both in Italy and abroad. The commitment and ability to carry out major projects led to the company successfully establishing itself abroad, where it has been operating since the seventies. As at 31 December 2011 turnover in the infrastructure and operating sector in Italy and abroad totaled 734 million euros, equal to 68% of the 2011 consolidated turnover. In 2017, Engineering News-Record's Top 250 International Contractors report ranked Impresa Pizzarotti #121, jumping from #178 in 2016.[3] Pizzarotti is organized into the following main business areas: Infrastructure, Building Sector, Energy Sector, Real Estate Sector, Prefabricated construction, and Concessions. In early 2017, Enrica, Pietro and Michele Pizzarotti, daughter and sons of Impresa Pizzarotti & C.'s Chairman Mr. Paolo Pizzarotti, themselves involved on different level in the family company,  gave birth to Fondazione Pizzarotti, a private No Profit Charity Foundation aimed to support disadvantaged childhood, social development, culture, environment and education in Italy and overseas.[4] ",

It is one of the leading European manufacturers and distributors of major domestic appliances (washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, fridges, freezers, cookers, hoods, ovens and hobs).[2] It claims to be the undisputed leader in major markets such as Italy, the UK and Russia.[2] Founded in 1975 and listed on the Milan stock exchange since 1987, the Group posted sales of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2013. It has eight industrial areas (in Italy, Poland, the UK, Russia and Turkey) and 16,000 employees. Founded in 1975 as Merloni Elettrodomestici SpA by Vittorio Merloni, as a spin-off from Industrie Merloni. Merloni Elettrodomestici bought Indesit in 1987. It was renamed Indesit Company S.p.A in 2005 after the company it acquired.[3][4] In the 1980s, with other Italian companies having been taken over by foreign appliance manufacturers, Merloni Household became the premier domestic producer in the industry. From 1981 the company went through a period of crisis, which ended in 1984, when Vittorio Merloni, having concluded his presidency of Confindustria, returned to managing Indesit. Profits and revenues of the company grew, and this led the Merloni family to decide in 1986 in favor of the company's entry into the stock market. In 1987, Merloni Elettrodomestici, already listed on the stock exchange, acquired Indesit (founded in Torino as Industria Elettrodomestici Spirea Italia SpA, a subsidiary of Spirea srl, by Armando Campioni, Adelchi Candellero and Filippo Gatta in 1953), its biggest rival on the Italian market which also had a certain international presence, as well as 33% of Philco Italy. In 1988, Merloni, under the Ariston and Indesit brands, had a turnover of 1.059 billion dollars, becoming the fourth largest European manufacturer of home appliances. The following year, it acquired and absorbed the French company Scholt\u00e8s. In 1990, Merloni capital entered Marcegaglia, its supplier of steel tubes, which detected 7% of the shares. In the same year the Company had approximately 6,000 employees in various establishments including France, Portugal and Russia. In 1994, Merloni had a turnover of 1,920 billion lire with a market share of 10% in Europe. The following year took over one third of the capital of Star S.p.A. (Societ\u00e0 Trevigiana Apparecchi Riscaldamento), an Italian company of Conegliano Veneto producer of kitchen hoods, which will be fully acquired in 2002 and merged with the Company in 2003. In 1999, through Fineldo, the holding of Merloni family, acquired Panini, manufacturer of collectible stickers. In 2000, Indesit took over  the entire capital of Philco and acquired Stinol, the first Russian producer of household appliances. The Company of Fabriano in 2002 entered the consumer electronics industry with the purchase of Sinudyne. In 2005, Indesit Company closes its French industrial site in Thionville.[5] In February 2005, Merloni Elettrodomestici was renamed Indesit Company: Indesit is the best known of the Group\u2019s brands outside Italy. At the beginning of 2007, Indesit Company launched the Group\u2019s new brand architecture:  Hotpoint brand is combined with Ariston to form the Hotpoint-Ariston brand. On 31 July 2009 the Indesit closed its plant at Kinmel Park, Bodelwyddan Denbighshire, Wales, UK.  The factory employed 305 workers.  The company blamed \"continuing decline\" in the market.[6] Andrea Merloni from 2010 succeeded his father Vittorio to lead the Company as the new Chairman. On 9 June 2010, the Company announced an investment of 120 million over the 3-year period 2010-2012 to consolidate its presence in Italy and simultaneously the closure of the two plants Brembate (Bergamo) and Refrontolo (Treviso). In May 2011, the company signed sponsorship deals with Arsenal Football Club, of London. In October 2012, Indesit signed a supply agreement with Waterlogic for advanced water purification devices.[7] The agreement was valid until 2015. In 2012 Indesit Company announced its entry into the Small Domestic Appliances market. In 2013, with reference to the year 2012, the maximum A+ application level was reached in the Sustainability Report. In May 2013 Marco Milani was appointed Chairman of the group, maintaining simultaneously the role of CEO. In 2014, Whirlpool Corporation agreed to pay 758 million euros to buy a 60\u00a0% stake in Indesit, which was a market leader in Italy, the United Kingdom and Russia, from the Merloni family to further expand outside its U.S. home market.[8] In 2017, police investigation pointed to a Indesit made Hotpoint fridge freezer, model FF175BP of 2006-2009 (discontinued since then), caused the Grenfell Tower fire which became the deadliest blaze in London since World War Two.[9] Indesit posted sales of \u20ac2.9 billion in 2012.  Indesit Company has eight production sites, of which three are in Italy (Fabriano, Comunanza and Caserta), and five are abroad (two in Poland, one in the UK, one in Russia and one in Turkey) counting 16 thousand employees.

            "text": "Innocenti was an Italian machinery works originally established by Ferdinando Innocenti in 1920. Over the years they produced Lambretta scooters as well as a range of automobiles, mainly of British Leyland origins. The brand was retired in 1996, six years after being a quotes by Fiat. After World War II, the company was famous for many years for Lambretta scooters models such as LI125, LI150, TV175, TV200, SX125, SX150, SX200, GP125, GP150 and GP200. From 1961 to 1976 Innocenti built under licence the BMC (later the British Leyland Motor Corporation / BLMC) Mini, with 848, 998\u00a0cc and 1,275\u00a0cc engines, followed by other models, including, from 1973, the Regent (Allegro), with engines up to 1,485\u00a0cc. The company of this era is commonly called Leyland Innocenti. The Innocenti Spyder (1961\u201370) was a rebodied version of the Austin-Healey MKII Sprite (styling by Ghia). The car was produced by OSI, near Milan. In 1972 BLMC took over control of the company. In 1972 the company's land, buildings and equipment were purchased by British Leyland in a deal involving approximately \u00a33 million.[1] The British company had high hopes for its newly acquired subsidiary at a time when, they reported to the UK press, Italian Innocenti sales were second only to those of Fiat, and ahead of Volkswagen and Renault:[1] there was talk of further increasing annual production from 56,452 in 1971 to 100,000. However, the peak production under BLMC was 62,834 in 1972, in spite of exports increasing from one car in 1971 to more than 17,000 in 1974.[2] Demonstrating their ambitions, the British company installed as managing director one of their youngest UK based senior executives, the 32-year-old former financial controller Geoffrey Robinson.[1] Three years later BLMC ran out of money and was nationalised by the UK government. In February 1976, the company passed to Alejandro de Tomaso and was reorganised by the De Tomaso Group under the name Nuova Innocenti. Benelli had a share and British Leyland retained five percent, with De Tomaso owning forty-four percent with the aid of a rescue plan from GEPI (an Italian public agency intended to provide investment for troubled corporations).[3] Management was entirely De Tomaso's responsibility, however, and later in 1976 GEPI and De Tomaso combined their 95% of Innocenti (and all of Maserati) into one new holding company.[4] However, with the loss of the original Mini, the Austin I5, and the (slow-selling) Regent, sales were in freefall. Production was nearly halved in 1975 and was down to about a fifth of the 1974 levels in 1976. After this crisis, however, the new Bertone-bodied Mini began selling more strongly and production climbed to a steady 40,000 per annum by the end of the 1970s.[2] The first models had Bertone-designed five-seater bodywork and was available with Leyland's 998\u00a0cc and 1,275\u00a0cc engines. Exports, which had been carried out mainly by British Leyland's local concessionaires, began drying up in the early eighties as BL did not want to see internal competition from the Innocenti Mini. Sales to France (Innocenti's biggest export market) ended in 1980, with German sales coming to a halt in 1982.[5] Around the same time, the engine deal with Leyland ended, and production soon dropped into the low twenty thousands. Having lost their engine supply as well as their entire export dealer net, Innocenti found themselves without a product and the means of selling it. Luckily, Daihatsu of Japan were in need of a European partner. In addition to providing drivetrains, Daihatsu gave Innocenti access to their burgeoning sales network, entering France, Belgium, and Switzerland at first. Daihatsu gained access to the Italian market, and a means of entry into other European nations with steep barriers for Japanese-made cars. That Innocenti, like Daihatsu, was a small-car specialist only made the marriage even more suitable.[6] And so it was that, from model year 1983 on, the Innocenti was completely reengineered, now using the Daihatsu Charade's 993\u00a0cc three-cylinder engine and an entirely new suspension. The appearance did not change in the least, in spite of it being, in essence, a new car.[6] De Tomaso developed a turbocharged version of this engine for Daihatsu which found use in both Innocenti and Daihatsu cars.[7] In addition to building their own cars, De Tomaso also had Innocenti use their factory capacity in producing bodywork for and providing final assembly of the Maserati Biturbo,[7] Quattroporte, and the Chrysler TC by Maserati. As production kept decreasing, and prices vis-\u00e0-vis competing Fiat products increased, Innocenti attempted to stay relevant by adding ever higher and more individual equipment.[8] Innocenti kept building their own cars until early 1993. Beginning in 1990, when Fiat took over, Innocenti also sold Yugo's Koral and Brazilian-sourced versions of the Fiat Uno (Elba station wagon and Uno Mille) in the Italian market.[9] The marque ended when sales of these rebadged models came to a halt in 1996.[10] The Lambretta scooter was relaunched once again at the EICMA Milan Motorcycle Expo in  November 2017.[11]After the purchase of the Lambretta branding by Innocenti SA, now a Swiss consortium, a new scooter model was designed and launched. This was the V-special, available in 50 to 125 to 200cc enigne sizes, and designed to meet Euro 4 standards. The scooter was designed in Austria by Austrian firm Kiska, but produced in Asia. It saw exports to Australia, Philippines,  Europe, the US and UK [12] The company plans to reintroduce classic models at a later date [13] [14] Lambretta are developing production facilities in India, teaming up with Lohia Auto of Noida and the Bird Group of New Delhi. There are plans to launch an electric scooter in 2020 [15]  Media related to Innocenti at Wikimedia Commons ",

It develops OPC software products and knowledge management platforms for manufacturers primarily in the oil and gas, refining and petrochemicals, chemical, food and beverage, steel and pharmaceutical industries. It also provides consulting services.[3] Integration Objects is a member of the OPC Foundation,[4] the International Society of Automation and MIMOSA.[5] It has also collaborated and partnered with other IT companies such as Invensys, OSIsoft,[6] Gensym [7] and ABB for large projects and its clients include ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco and Solvay Chemicals. OPC technology follows a set of open standards specifications, created and managed by the OPC Foundation, to ensure interoperability between devices and systems in industrial automation and within other enterprise systems. The origins of OPC are based on Microsoft's OLE, COM and DCOM technology and today's OPC set of standards allow field systems and other devices, automation and control applications and business applications to communicate acquired real-time and historical data and records to enterprise systems and between production devices from multiple vendors. The standards are evolving and are created or rewritten to account for emerging technologies and trends.[8] Manufacturing companies invest large amounts of money in industrial automation infrastructures, but many have yet to realize the full value from their investment as many remain islands of automation - information silos disconnected from other systems, including business systems.[9] Enormous amounts of data may be available, but companies often lack the proper infrastructure that would allow them to adequately share data so they can use it to improve process efficiency and profitability. Integration between process control, plant-level and enterprise systems is no longer an option for manufacturing and energy companies if they want to remain competitive. Convergence of the IT world with automation and process controls greatly helps in this effort by providing economically and technically competitive solutions. However, the sharing of process information within and between networks must be done in a way that aligns with the overall security policies of the enterprise.[10] This is why system integrators must find customized solutions that fit the specific company's needs and goals.[11] Many enterprises across various industries face the same issue - important resources such as data, information, and knowledge are embedded in computer systems, documentation, and in the minds of individuals across an organization but accessing it can be both extremely difficult and time-consuming.[12] However, by using intelligent computer platforms to not only capture and integrate this knowledge, but analyze, organize and store it as well, users can monitor and manage operations and performances and effectively make safe and smart decisions rapidly to improve results. Knowledge management allows an organization to benefit from the collective knowledge of its written resources and employees' experiences and know-how.[13] Applications of knowledge management systems can be found in many fields. For example, in case of abnormal plant conditions, knowledge management platforms allow an operator to identify the root cause of the problem and the correct action that should be taken by automatically reviewing the stored and analyzed data found in the system.[14] Knowledge management can be a strategic asset necessary for an organization to remain competitive.[15] ",

In 2014 it was the largest banking group in Italy by market capitalization, and second by total assets.[7][8] The bank has also experienced growth in the international market, focused in Central-Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.[9]  When it was formed in 2007 it overtook Unicredit Group as the largest bank in Italy with 13 million customers and US$690 billion worth of assets.[10]  By 2010 its assets had grown to US$877.66 billion, ranking 26th in Forbes Global 2000.[11][12] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[13] In August 2018, Intesa Sanpaolo launched XME pay digital wallet.[14][15] Banca Intesa and Sanpaolo IMI, the two banks that merged in 2007 to create Intesa Sanpaolo, were themselves the product of many mergers.[16] Cariplo and Banco Ambrosiano Veneto merged in 1998 to form Banca Intesa. The following year Banca Commerciale Italiana joined the group. Sanpaolo IMI was born in 1998 following the merger of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, which specialized in retail banking, and IMI (Istituto Mobiliare Italiano), an investment bank.[16] The oldest part of the banking group is Cariplo Sp.A.. which traces its roots to Austrian Empire household savings bank Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde which was established in 1823 in Milan. The cassa di risparmio was started by an Italian philanthropic group, the Central Committee of Charity; a response by the government to the hard economic times of the early 19th century. In the early 20th century the bank helped Italian companies in the North obtain capital during and after World Wars 1 and 2, chiefly under the guidance of Giordano Dell'Amore. Banking reforms in 1990 started by Giuliano Amato (Amato Law; it:Legge Amato) led to the restructuring/reorganization of banks by forcing the government to relinquish control of them (the result was a more market driven bank that focused less on social programs/social causes were abandoned).[17] Cariplo SpA was formed in 1991 when Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (sold by Ente Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde ) merged with its subsidiary IBI.  Banco Ambrosiano Veneto originated with Nuovo Banco Ambrosiano and Banca Cattolica del Veneto which merged in 1989.  The bank increased in size during the 1990s due to numerous acquisitions (Citibank Italia, Banca Vallone di Galatina and European securities dealer Caboto among others).[citation needed] Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) started in 1894 as a corporate loans lender operating in the commercial industry of Northern Italy.  In 1994 Mediobanca purchased an interest in BCI (ironically BCI was one of the 3 banks that formed Mediobanca almost 50 years earlier).  BCI tried to acquire Banco Ambrosiano Veneto the same year but was spurned by shareholders who wouldn't accept the US$1.13 billion offer.  In 1999 Italy's largest bank Unicredit Group at the time, attempted a hostile takeover of BCI but failed due to Mediobanca's interest in the company (Mediobanca wanted to merge Banca di Roma with BCI)[18] BCI merged with the former Banca Ambrosiano and Cariplo in 1998 to form a financial institution renamed Banca Intesa in 2003.[citation needed] Sanpaolo IMI was formed in 1998 when Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI) merged, (IMI itself was established in 1931) in a US 37.8 billion dollar deal.[10] In January 2007, Banca Intesa and Sanpaolo IMI, two of the three largest bank of Italy, officially merged.[19] As part of the authorization of the merger, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) forbid Intesa Sanpaolo to open any new branches for two years in the provinces of Udine and Gorizia (Friuli \u2013 Venezia Giulia region), provinces of Rovigo and Padua (Veneto region), Aosta Valley, provinces of Biella and Alessandria (Piedmont region), Province of Bolzano (South Tyrol), Province of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna region), Province of Pavia (Lombardy region), Province of Naples (Campania region), Province of Imperia (Liguria region), provinces of Sassari and Cagliari (Sardinia Island), Province of Rieti (Lazio region), province of Terni (Umbria region), Province of Pesaro-Urbino (Marche region), Province of Pescara (Abruzzo region) and Province of Catanzaro (Calabria region).[20] The French banking group Cr\u00e9dit Agricole started to spin off from Intesa Sanpaolo, by acquiring Cariparma, FriulAdria in 2007 and Carispezia in 2011, as well as branches from Intesa Sanpaolo. In 2012, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole sold all the shares of Intesa Sanpaolo.[citation needed] In December 2007, Cassa di Risparmio di Biella e Vercelli was also sold to Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena for \u20ac399 million.[21] In 2008, Intesa Sanpaolo acquired Banca CR Firenze. In December 2008, Cassa di Risparmio di Fano was sold to Credito Valtellinese.[citation needed] In 2009, group acquisitions included a 30% interest in business info company MF Honyvem, and an increased stake in Alitalia \u2013 Compagnia Aerea Italiana up to 33.3%[22]  Even though the bank was rumoured to have been working with the government to keep Air France from acquiring a stake in Alitalia, Air France eventually acquired 25%.[23][24] Alitalia \u2013 Compagnia Aerea Italiana sold part of its stake in the airline to Etihad Airways in 2015. From 2012 to 2013, Intesa Sanpaolo write down the value of investment in Banca delle Marche (a minority interests of 5.84% share capital) for a total of \u20ac90 million (\u20ac18 + 72 million), as well as \u20ac26 million for a minority stake in Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti in 2014. The shareholders of the banks was bail-in in the rescue plan in 2015.[citation needed] In 2014, Cassa di Risparmio di Venezia and Banca di Credito Sardo were absorbed into Intesa Sanpaolo. The 2014\u201317 business plan of the bank stated that the banking group would simplified their legal structure.[citation needed] In 2015, local banks Banca Monte Parma, Banca di Trento e Bolzano, Cassa di Risparmio di Civitavecchia, Cassa di Risparmio di Rieti and Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Viterbo were absorbed into Intesa Sanpaolo. Banca dell'Adriatico and Casse di Risparmio dell'Umbria were planned to be absorb by Intesa Sanpaolo in mid-2016. A unified website was also used for the remaining retail banks of the group in 2016.[citation needed] In 2016\u201317, the banking group also sold their non-core businesses, such as the 0.49% ordinary shares of Visa Europe in cash plus share deal;[25] Intesa Sanapolo Card and subsidiary Setefi to Mercury (the parent company of Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane) for \u20ac1.035\u00a0billion[26][27] and 4.88% shares of Bank of Italy to the bank's shareholders Compagnia di San Paolo, Fondazione Cariplo and the pension funds of the group for \u20ac366\u00a0million.[28] On 26 June 2017,[29] as part of a government funded bail-out of the depositors (and the bail-in of the investors of the failed banks), Intesa Sanpaolo acquired the good assets of Banca Popolare di Vicenza (BPVi) and Veneto Banca, including some of the subsidiaries such as Banca Apulia and Banca Nuova. The branches of BPVi and Veneto Banca would at first became branches of Intesa Sanpaolo, but some of them would be closed down in the near future for efficiency, as Intesa Sanapolo was also one of the major bank in Veneto region which the failed banks based. In October 2017, the plan to absorb Banca Nuova into Intesa Sanpaolo was also announced. In December 2017, the plan to absorb Cassa di Risparmio del Friuli Venezia Giulia was announced. On 6 February 2018, 10 further mergers were announced in the 2018\u20132021 business plan: Banco di Napoli. Banca CR Firenze, CR Pistoia e della Lucchesia, CR Veneto, Carisbo, Cariromagna, Banca Apulia, Banca IMI, Banca Prossima and Mediocredito Italiano.[30] Intesa Sanpaolo's shareholders with more than a 3% stake Many shareholders of the group were the former owner (foundation) of the saving banks that were acquired by Intesa and Sanapaolo IMI through shares swap. For example, as of 31 December 2013, Fondazione Carisap (Ascoli) held 0.3537% shares,[32] Fondazione Carisbo (Bologna) held 2.023%,[33] Fondazione Cariparma (Parma, now part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group) held 0.67%,[34] Fondazione Carispezia (La Spezia, now part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group) held 0.25%,[35] Fondazione di Venezia (Venice) held 0.33215%.[36] Intesa Sanpaolo has a single-tiered corporate governance system in which the Board of Directors alone are in charge of strategic supervision and control. The latter duty is carried out by the Management Control Committee instead of the Board of Directors itself. The bank adopted this single-tiered system in April 2016, replacing the former two-tiered structure. Previously, the supervisory board exercised control and strategic management functions, whereas the management board oversaw the management of the company\u2019s business. The supervisory board was appointed by shareholders in their annual meeting. It supervised the activities carried out by the management board and, in particular, approved the main strategic initiatives proposed by the management board. The management board appointed one of its members to be the CEO.[37][38] Members were appointed on April 27, 2016 for the following financial years: 2016, 2017 and 2018.[6] Table with a comparison of Intesa Sanpaolo financial performance over the last years.[6] The group's operations are segmented into 7 parts[40] In addition to its strong presence in Italy, Intesa Sanpaolo has branches and representative offices around the world. The Group also directly controls many foreign banks, especially in Central-Eastern Europe and Middle East and North Africa, with around 1,600 branches and about 8.3 million clients operating in retail and commercial banking.[40][44] Intesa Sanpaolo former headquarters in piazza San Carlo, Turin Intesa Sanpaolo building Palazzo delle Colonne, Milan ",

The trademark was originated by Umberto Gemmati and continues to be produced by his descendants. In Italian, the word iride means the iris of the eye and is pronounced like the root of the word iridescent. Iride had a race winning heyday during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Victories on road courses and velodromes were made by notable racers including Nino Florean. The office of the factory displays many trophies. The nearby Mecchia velodrome, in Portogruaro, is featured in historical photos of the racers.[1] The company is best known for producing hand-brazed lugged steel frame bikes using primarily Columbus tubing, also Oria tubing; and mainly utilizing Miche components because of the high performance[2] and the fact that they are close by in San Vendemiano. The Iride workshop pays special attention to finish, using a large powder coating oven. Gemmati Velocipedi  also uses imported aluminum frames and Italian components to make a range of more ordinary bicycles including (what Americans would call a hybrid) their popular City Bike. The prestigious Robb Report called Iride \"The Maserati of Bicycles\"[3] for the similar history of the two brands: early race success, uncomplicated classic Italian design, up to current manufacture of premium road vehicles. Iride is also grouped with \"top bike makers\" in Barron's,[4] and called \"nimble\" in Details.[5] Iride bicycles have been available in North America since 2010. ",

Iso are known for the iconic Isetta bubble car of the 1950s, and for a number of powerful performance cars in the 1960s and early 1970s. Iso was initially named 'Isothermos' and manufactured refrigeration units before World War II. The company was founded in Genoa in 1939, but was transferred to Bresso in 1942 by Renzo Rivolta, an engineer and the heir of industrialists. The business was refounded as Iso Autoveicoli S.p.A. in 1953 to reflect the production of motorized transport. Renzo Rivolta died in 1966, and his son, Piero, took over as managing director.[1]    At the start of 1973 the Rivolta family ceded the business to an Italian American financier named Ivo Pera who promised to bring American management know-how to the firm:[2]   the business was again renamed to Iso Motors, just before fading rapidly into obscurity. Two prototypes were shown in the 1990s; however, neither reached production. After the Second World War, the company reopened its doors, completely changing its activity. In 1948 it began to build motorcycles, scooters and motocarries (three-wheeled transport scooters/motorcycles). Among the most famous are the Furetto (1948), 'Isoscooter (1950),' Isocarro (1951), 'Isomoto (1954), ' Isosport (1953) and ' Iso Diva. The last Iso motorcycle was presented as the Iso 500 in 1961. Isomotos were known as expensive, but durable and well-built. In the late 1960s Iso Rivolta also built a motorized sled (\"ski-doo\") called ' Iso Neve. In the mid-1950s, he started to develop a miniature car for two persons and front entrance, initially with only three wheels, later, for reasons of stability, with four wheels (the two on the rear very close together): the Isetta Bubble Car.  About 20,000 of the bubble cars were built at the Iso works near Milan. Starting in 1954, Isetta was licensed to automobile manufacturers in several countries: France (by VELAM), Spain, Great Britain and Brazil (by Romi). The most successful, however, was the German[1] Isetta built by BMW. The BMW-Isetta went on to dwarf the production volumes of Iso and become one of the best-selling German microcars in the 1950s and 1960s.   About 130,000 had been sold by 1962. Together with engineer Giotto Bizzarrini, designer Giorgetto Giugiaro and chassis builder Bertone, Renzo Rivolta began developing the Iso Rivolta IR 300, which was first presented at the Torino Show of 1962. It was an elegant 2 + 2 Coup\u00e9 with well-balanced technical components and outstanding driving performance. The 5.4\u00a0L V8 Chevrolet Small-Block engine and the transmission came from General Motors in Detroit, and the de Dion suspension and four-wheel disc braking system came from the large Jaguars of the time. This concept was maintained for almost all production cars of Iso. Starting in 1971, Ford 351 Cleveland engines replaced the GM small block. Iso's most well-known Gran Turismo automobile was the Iso Grifo which featured a low-slung, sporty berlinetta body by Bertone. After Bizzarrini left the project, this prototype formed the basis for his own Bizzarini 5300 GT. The Grifo Prototype was further refined by Iso, receiving a reworked, less aggressive and more luxurious body in the process, and went into production in 1965. The Grifo was powered by Chevrolet\u00b4s 327 cubic inch (5.4 litre) small-block V-8 producing either 300 or 350\u00a0hp. In 1966 a convertible version of the Grifo was shown, but never reached production. Starting in 1968 the Grifo was also available with Chevrolet's 427 cubic inch big-block V-8; this version was known as the Grifo 7 litri and was easily recognized by the broad air inlet on the hood. Later-day Grifos, the Series II, featured concealed headlights and a slightly modified front area. After the sudden death at Milan on 20 August 1966[3] of Renzo Rivolta, his son Piero became the director of Iso, aged only 25 then. Under Piero's leadership, Iso built the limousine 'S 4 (for \"four seats\", later to be called 'Fidia, \"the fastest four seats on wheels\" (Advertisement, 1967) with body by Ghia, the Grifo 7 litri (with the GM V8 7\u00a0L marine engine) and the 2 + 2 fastback Coup\u00e9 Lele (1969) with body designed by Bertone, intended as the successor to the IR 300. The Iso Rivolta plant moved from Bresso to Varedo in 1972. Apart from the models Grifo Series II, Fidia and Lele, the mid-engined Iso Varedo was developed there, the chassis concept came from Giotto Bizzarrini and the design was from  Ercole Spada , but only one car was ever built. Iso went bankrupt in 1974, only 1700 Iso Gran Turismos had been built in those ten years. Data from automobile-catalog.com.[4] ",

Founded in Milan, Italy, in 1900 by Cesare Isotta and the brothers Vincenzo, Antonio, and Oreste Fraschini, in 1955 it was merged with engine manufacturer Breda Motori and renamed F.A. Isotta Fraschini e Motori Breda. The company went bankrupt in 1999. In 2000, a new company was founded as a subsidiary of Fincantieri, under the name of Isotta Fraschini Milano based in Bari. The firm was named for its founders, Cesare Isotta and Vincenzo Fraschini, who had been importing Mors and Renault automobiles as well as Aster proprietary engines since 1899.[1] The company they founded as Societ\u00e0 Milanese Automobili Isotta, Fraschini & C. on 27 January 1900 had the stated purpose to \"Import, sell, repair cars\". Prior to establishing their own products in 1904, Isotta and Fraschini assembled cars very similar to Renaults, with Aster engines. They differed from the real Renaults in having a neater underslung front radiator arrangement.[2] The first automobile bearing this marque featured a four-cylinder engine with an output of 24 horsepower (18\u00a0kW). The car, driven by Vincenzo Fraschini, appeared in several races. In 1905, Isotta Fraschini gained notoriety in the Coppa Florio, where they entered a Tipo D with a 17.2-litre (1,050\u00a0cu\u00a0in) 100 horsepower (75\u00a0kW) engine. For a short time in 1907, Isotta Fraschini merged with French automobile company Lorraine-Dietrich. The firm started making race cars using this same 100 horsepower (75\u00a0kW) engine, establishing the company's reputation and giving its name considerable cachet. It was also one of the first companies to successfully market cars with four-wheel brakes, following their invention by Arrol-Johnston of Scotland in 1909.[3] They were also among the early pioneers of overhead cam (OHC), with an engine designed by Giustino Cattaneo.[4] Isotta Fraschini introduced their Tipo 8, the first production automobile to be powered by a straight-eight engine, at the Paris Salon in 1919[5] and began delivering them to customers in 1920.[6] With the growth of the wealthy middle class in North America in the 1920s, Isotta Fraschini marketed deluxe limousines to the new American aristocracy. Early film stars Clara Bow and Rudolph Valentino drove Isotta Fraschinis. A 1929 Tipo 8A Castagna Transformable is featured in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard[7] and another appears in the 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday with Fredric March. An Isotta Fraschini also makes a featured appearance in the 1946 film Without Reservations with John Wayne and Claudette Colbert. Also, an Isotta Fraschini was gigolo Lindsay Marriott's car in Raymond Chandler's book Farewell, My Lovely (1940) that was made into the motion picture Murder, My Sweet (1944), starring Dick Powell and Claire Trevor. The grille of the Isotta Fraschini with the lightning bolt insignia is seen parked in a ravine, right before Lindsay Marriott gets zapped to death. An oversized Isotta Fraschini is also the vehicle of choice for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1933 novel Tender is the Night. Seriously affected by the economic crisis of the 1930s and by the disruptions of World War II, Isotta Fraschini stopped making cars after the war (1949). Only five of the last model, the Monterosa, were produced. The plants were converted to produce marine engines. The company was left on the company register and in 1955 it was merged with engine manufacturer Breda Motori and named F.A. Isotta Fraschini e Motori Breda. The company started to produce trolley buses again and in 1960s built a new diesel engine factory in Bari. In the 1980s, the company was renamed Isotta Fraschini Motori SpA and it became part of Fincantieri group, with administrative headquarters in the old factory in Bari. In the 1990s, attempts to revive the automotive industry of Isotta Fraschini were made. Concept-car coupe and roadster Isotta Fraschini T8 were built in 1996, and concept-car roadster Isotta Fraschini T12 was built in 1998. The company never went into production and closed for bankruptcy in 1999. Vincenzo Trucco won the 1908 Targa Florio with Isotta Fraschini type I.

            "text": "Italcementi is an  Italian multinational company, quoted on the Borsa Italiana, which produces cement, ready-mix concrete and construction aggregates. In 2015, 45% of Italcementi was acquired by HeidelbergCement, together forming the world's second largest cement producer. Italcementi was founded in 1846 in Scanzo near Bergamo, Italy, as the Societ\u00e0 Bergamasca per la fabbricazione del cemento e della calce idraulica (Bergamo Company for the production of cement and hydraulic lime). The company produced a new grade of cement, the Scanzo cement, that grew in popularity and was used in various projects such as the 16-arches bridge above the Adda river, the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station and the Suez Canal (underwater concrete). [1] In the early 1920s, the company merged with the construction group owned by the Pesenti family, forming a 12-plant and 1500-employee  group producing +200 tons of cement annually. In 1925, it was introduced on the Italian stock exchange. The company became Italcementi in 1927. In the fifties, Italcementi provided the cement for the construction of the Pirelli Tower.[1][2] In 1992 it underwent internationalisation following the acquisition of Ciments Fran\u00e7ais, which made it the largest cement producer of the world. Since 1998, it has further expanded through acquisitions of new cement works in Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Morocco, India, Egypt, Kuwait, and the United States. In 2010, Ciments fran\u00e7ais bought its obligations back from its US creditors to pave the way for a merger with its parent company Italcementi, merger that had previously faced a strong opposition from the aforementioned US stakeholders.[3] In June 2014, Italcementi, already an 83% shareholder in Ciments fran\u00e7ais, launched a bid to buy the remaining 17%. By the end of the takeover bid in July 2014, Italcementi reached 97,73% participation in Ciments fran\u00e7ais, and remained confident it would reach the 100% threshold[4][5][6] During the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010, Italcementi introduced the first transparent cement (trademarked as i.light) using thermoplastic polymer resin inserted in the special cement mixture.[7] In 2007, Italcementi introduced a new cement that retains smog with enhanced titanium dioxyde.[8] In 2015, Italcementi introduced a smog-purifying biodynamic cement with photocatalytic properties\u00a0: it converts polluants contained in the outside air into inert salts.[9] In July 2015, German construction group HeidelbergCement (world\u2019s 4th cement producer), agreed to buy a 45% stake in Italcementi (world\u2019s 5th cement producer) for $1.85 billion from the Pesenti family (through the family's holding group, Italmobiliare), thus creating the world's 2nd largest cement producer. As a trade-off, the Pesenti family gets 5% of the newly formed group, making them the second largest shareholders after the Merckle family[10][11] In May 2016, the European commission approved the deal.[12] The acquisition led to 400 lay-offs of Italcementi employees in Italy.[13] The deal was announced a week after Lafarge merged with Holcim, and amid rumors that Dangote Cement was eyeing an acquisition of Italcementi.[14] On 12 October 2016, HeidelbergCement purchased the remaining Italcementi shares. Therefore, HeidelbergCement is now the sole shareholder of Italcementi and owns 100% of the share capital. The Italcementi Group is based in the town of Bergamo, in northern Italy. It has a staff of more than 20,000 employees, of which 400 are engaged in technical support and research activities under the group company C.T.G SpA (CTG stands for 'Centro Tecnico di Gruppo). Italcementi's annual sales are over 6 billion euros. Italcementi is implemented in 22 countries: Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Gambia, Greece, India, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. Over 60% of its sales come from the cement sector which is combined with the production of ready-mixed concrete and aggregates. It boasts of a global network including 62 cement plants (cement + clinker 54 MT[clarification needed]), 12 grinding centers, 4 terminals (one of which is also a grinding center), 570 concrete batching units (20.8 million cubic metres) and 152 quarries aggregate quarries (56.7 MT[clarification needed]) Italcementi is controlled by Italmobiliare, based in Milan and quoted on the Borsa Italiana. The whole group has been controlled by the Italian Pesenti family since its foundation in 1864. ",

The purchase price was not disclosed. The Giugiaro family retained ownership of the remaining shares. Both Giorgetto Giugiaro and his son, Fabrizio Giugiaro, continued to have active roles in the company.[2][1][5][9] In July 2015 it was announced that Giorgetto Giugiaro had left and sold the remaining shares to Audi AG. Italdesign created a new firm, Dise\u00f1o Industrial Italdesign Srl, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 to design and construct models, master models and prototypes for the Spanish manufacturing industry. This subsidiary is known today as Italdesign Giugiaro Barcelona SL.[6][11] In 2017 the company founded a daughter company dedicated to building collector vehicles. Named ITALDESIGN AUTOMOBILI SPECIALI, the new brand will feature on all vehicles constructed in ultra low series production, aimed at a number of selected collectors. The first car to be produced is the Zerouno with a production of only five units.[12] Cars produced or planned by the new group. Italdesign acquired SALLIG, a company founded in 1960 that designs and builds acrylic, cast iron and zamak matrices for automotive, aeronautical and household appliance prototypes.[6] Italdesign acquired ETM (Engineering Technologies Methods), a company founded in 1984 that creates silicone prototypes, allowing the transition from an acrylic prototype to a more refined prototype with characteristics similar to the finished product.[6] Italdesign-Giugiaro S.p.A is headquartered 10\u00a0km south of Turin, Italy, in Moncalieri.[7] Best known for its automobile design work, Italdesign also offers project management, styling, packaging, engineering, modeling, prototyping and testing services.[4] Italdesign has 993 employees and generated over \u20ac193 million revenue in 2015.[1] Under Volkswagen Group ownership, Rupert Stadler is the Chairman of the Board and J\u00f6rg Astalosch is CEO.[citation needed][15] Italdesign has been credited for the design of a wide variety of concept and production cars since the firm's founding in 1968.

It designs and builds light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles, quarry/construction site vehicles, city and intercity buses and special vehicles for applications such as firefighting, off-road missions, the military and civil defence. The name Iveco first appeared in 1975 after a merger of Italian, French and German brands.[1] Its production plants are in Europe, Brazil, Russia, Australia, Africa, Argentina and China, and it has approximately 5,000 points of sales and service in over 160 countries.  The worldwide output of the company amounts to around 150,000 commercial vehicles with a turnover of about \u20ac10,000,000,000.[2] IVECO was incorporated on 1 January 1975, with the merger of five different brands: FIAT Veicoli Industriali (with headquarters in Turin), OM (Brescia, Italy), Lancia Veicoli Speciali (Italy), Unic (France) and Magirus-Deutz (Germany).[3] Following the merger, the newly founded Iveco began rationalizing its product range, manufacturing plants and sales network, while keeping the original brands. From 1975 to 1979, the Iveco range included 200 basic models and 600 versions spanning from 2.7 tons of GVW for a light vehicle to over 40 tons for heavy vehicles, as well as buses and engines.[4][5] In 1977 the light to medium-weight Iveco Zeta range was introduced, replacing the twenty-year-old OM Lupetto. Integrating the FIAT-OM range with the Unic and Magirus lineups was completed by 1980.[6] IVECO moved in to work on increasing productivity and engine development.[6] In 1978 IVECO launched the first product in the range of Iveco-branded light vehicles, the Daily.[7] In 1980 Iveco built a turbo diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.[8] In this decade the corporate strategy was heavily oriented towards brand promotion and led to the sponsorship of sports events, such as the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, the Davis Cup in 1982, multiple championship boxing matches, the Jacques Cousteau expeditions in the Amazon basin in 1983 and the Raid Pigafetta, during which the IVECO-FIAT 75 PC 4x4 was first to make a full circle of the globe.[9] Two new divisions were also formed: bus diesel engines and firefighting vehicles.[10] In 1984 IVECO launched the TurboStar,[11] a heavy on-road vehicle that became a best-seller in Italy and an important player in the European market, selling a total of 50,000 in seven years.[12] In 1985 IVECO made the first light diesel engine with direct injection.[13] From 1986, IVECO S.p.A. held a 52% stake in Iveco Ford Truck Ltd, a joint venture (and effectively a merger) with Ford of Europe's truck division. Ford plants took over production and sales of the major vehicles in the Iveco range and continued production of the Ford Cargo.[14] In the mid-1980s, Astra, which produces dumpers and construction site/quarry vehicles in Piacenza, became part of Iveco Group.[15] In 1989 the first diesel engine with EGR to reduce polluting emissions compatible with commercial vehicles was produced and the new Daily launched that same year was fitted with it.[14] In 1990, the group purchased 60% control of the Spanish industrial company ENASA, which owned the industrial vehicle builder Pegaso.[14] In the 1990s, the EuroCargo, EuroTech, EuroTrakker and EuroStar vehicles represented a total facelift for the range.[14] The EuroCargo and the EuroTech were named \"Truck of the Year\" in 1992 and 1993 respectively and, for the first time, this recognition was awarded to the same manufacturer for two years in a row.[16] The English company Seddon Atkinson was purchased in 1991 and brought its long heritage of special vehicles for the construction and refuse collection industries.[17] That same year, the first TurboDaily assembly line was inaugurated at the Nanjing Motor Corporation in China.[18] In 1992, Iveco took over the primary constructor of industrial vehicles in Australia to form Ital, originally called International Trucks Australia.[19] In 2000 it was renamed Iveco Trucks Australia Limited.[17] In 1996 firefighting activities in Germany were structured under the company Iveco Magirus Brandschutztechnik GmbH.[20] The following year, these activities were boosted by the arrival of an Austrian company, L\u00f6hr, which then became L\u00f6hr Magirus.[17] In 1998 Cursor 8 was launched, followed the next year by Cursor 10, the first diesel engine with a variable geometry turbine and the first common rail diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.[20] The 125th anniversary of the presentation of the first Magirus ladder[21] was celebrated together with the delivery of the five-thousandth Magirus aerial ladder produced since the Second World War.[20] In 2003 IVECO entirely bought out Irisbus, originally part of a joint venture with Renault.[22] In 2004 the Iveco Motors brand was born, which became an umbrella for the production of engines, and the following year it was incorporated into the newly founded Fiat Powertrain Technologies. At the end of 2004, an agreement was reached between IVECO and the Chinese company SAIC (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation).[23] In 2006 IVECO sponsored the Winter Olympic Games in Turin with a fleet of 1,200 Irisbus buses.[24] The year after, IVECO became sponsor of the All Blacks, New Zealand's rugby team.[25] In 2009 Iveco became the trucks and commercial Vehicle supplier for the Moto GP,[26] together with the historical sponsorship to the Ferrari Racing Team, for which it supplies the vehicles that transport the single-seaters at all the Formula 1 World Championship races.[27] On 1 January 2011, Fiat Industrial was formed, incorporating CNH, Iveco and FPT Industrial.[28] In September of the same year, the Fiat Industrial Village was inaugurated in Turin, a multipurpose centre belonging to Fiat Industrial and created for the sales, assistance and product presentation for the Iveco, New Holland and FPT Industrial brands.[29] On 15 January 2012, Iveco won the 33rd edition of the Dakar rally with the Petronas De Rooy team and the Dutch driver Gerard De Rooy, behind the wheel of an Iveco Powerstar. De Rooy was followed by drivers Stacey and Biasion behind the wheel of two Iveco Trakker Evolution 2 vehicles, equipped with an FPT Industrial C13 engine with over 900\u00a0hp.[30] Iveco is the brand under which the light, medium and heavy vehicles are sold. The range of light vehicles is made up of the New Daily in its versions from 2.8\u202ft to 7.0\u202ft and with 4x4 drive. The range of medium vehicles includes the Eurocargo, available from 7\u202ft to 19\u202ft and with 4x2 or 4x4 drive.[31] Stralis and Trakker, from 19\u202ft to 72\u202ft, make up the heavy vehicle range in two, three, or four-axled versions with all-wheel drive or two-wheel drive.[32] Light to medium Medium Heavy Irisbus was a brand specialising in passenger transport vehicles spanning from minibuses to buses for city and intercity transportation and tour buses. On May 24, 2013, the brand was relaunched as Iveco Bus.[34][35] Heuliez Bus is a French limited company, it was part of the Henri Heuliez Group. It was formed in 1980. It is wholly owned by IVECO through its subsidiary Iveco Bus, and specializes in the manufacture of buses and coaches. Iveco Astra is a brand dedicated to off-road vehicles for construction and mining industry. It produces heavy on-road and off-road vehicles as well as heavy tractors for road transport and logistics vehicles, including armoured vehicles for the military. The company was founded in 1946, but has been part of Iveco since 1986.[36] Iveco Magirus is the brand dedicated to firefighting vehicles and their fittings. Iveco Magirus also produces aerial ladders, an industry in which it is the world leader. It was founded in 1866 as \"Magirus Kommanditist\" by Conrad Dietrich Magirus, fire chief in Ulm, Germany, who also invented the ladders for the firefighting vehicles.[37] Defence Vehicles specialises in military vehicles. Its headquarters are located in Bolzano, where the Iveco LMV is produced, one of the brand's most famous vehicles used by many armies in Europe and abroad.[38] Iveco Capital is Iveco's financial division which provides financing for customers to purchase vehicles.[39] For Iveco Bus (former Irisbus) facilities see Iveco Bus In 2011 IVECO's net revenues were \u20ac9,600,000,000, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.[43] The trading profit was \u20ac490,000,000.[44] A total of 153,384 vehicles were delivered, an 18.3% increase over 2010.[43] Iveco engines from the Cursor and Tector ranges observe the Euro VI standards[45] by adopting High Efficiency SCR (HI-eSCR) technology.[46] This technology optimises the processes of exhaust combustion and after-treatment, reducing consumption and enabling achievement of greater efficiency in the conversion of NOx emissions.[47] IVECO developed and built the first Daily with electric propulsion in 1986;[48] Later, the range was broadened to include trucks and city buses.[49] IVECO introduced the New Daily with electric propulsion and zero exhaust emissions, in which a battery system powers an electric three-phase asynchronous motor \u2013 through the aid of an inverter \u2013 in charge of moving the vehicle directly, while recovering energy during braking.[50] The vehicle runs on two to four batteries made with Na/NiCl2 (Sodium-nickel chlorine) technology at a nominal 278\u00a0Volts.[50] The maximum velocity is electronically limited to 70\u202fkm/h, while the vehicle's range is from 90 to 130\u202fkm on a fully charged battery, depending on the number of batteries and the mission.[50] The parallel hybrid solution incorporates both a Diesel engine and an electric engine that can be used individually or simultaneously, which makes for greater operating flexibility and allows the vehicle to work under both urban and non-urban conditions.[51] In 2010 IVECO introduced this technology on the Eurocargo Ibrido, a commercial vehicle for the European market with electri-diesel parallel propulsion for distributing and collecting goods in city centres. The payload capacity decreases by 200\u202fkg in comparison to diesel-engine models, but it is possible to save up to 30% on the urban cycle.[52][53]  The Eurocargo hybrid range is made up of two versions: IVECO has been active in this sector since 1990 with 6, 7, 4 and 12 metre buses for urban and suburban transportation. The series hybrid technology features a diesel engine \u2013 smaller than that of a traditional vehicle \u2013 that acts as a battery charger.[54] IVECO's range of light, medium and heavy vehicles and buses can run on methane.  Methane makes it possible to save on consumption by 38% per kg transported as compared to that consumed by diesel engines for the same payload and distance travelled. In addition, compared to Euro\u202fVI diesel engines, methane engines reduce NOx emissions by approximately 60% and particulates emissions by approximately 70%.[55] In April 2012 IVECO presented its first vehicle with this technology, the Stralis LNG. As opposed to vehicles with CNG technology, LNG technology takes the vehicle farther on a full tank (up to 750\u202fkm) and reduces the vehicle's tare thus increasing the load. The main difference between the two technologies lies in the type of natural gas storage employed, which in this case is kept in a liquid state at \u2212161\u202f\u00b0C in cryogenic tanks; it is then heated in a heat exchanger so that once it reaches the engine it is a gas.[56] Also, the noise emitted decreases by 3 to 6 decibels over an analogous diesel engine vehicle.[57] IVECO created the first prototype of a bifuel, diesel and ethanol-run vehicle. The technology was developed by Iveco together with FPT Industrial and Bosch.[58] The prototype uses a Trakker truck with Common Rail Cursor\u202f9 engine with 360\u202fHP[58] that may be powered by a 40\u201360% ethanol-diesel blend.[59] The prototype was tested by Ra\u00edzen, a joint venture between the cane sugar producer Cosan and Shell.[59]  In 2011, this prototype earned Iveco the \"Pr\u00eamio Top Etanol\" \u2013 for the alternative fuel technology.[58] A prototype of a heat pump system for electric and hybrid vehicles was installed on the Iveco Daily vehicle. The system cools or heats the passenger compartment by transferring low temperature heat generated by the drive systems. At the same time, the control strategies minimise the energy demand in order to achieve a low impact on consumption.[60] Iveco Massif Iveco Indcar Mago 2 midibus in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland Daily van (MY98) in Romania Iveco Daily S2000 minibus Iveco Daily S2000 Chassis-cab Iveco Eurocargo (Model Year 2015) Iveco Trakker Iveco Stralis Iveco Stralis racing truck Iveco EuroStar Iveco TurboCity-U 480 bus in Bucharest, Romania (operated by RATB) Iveco Magirus Super Dragon X8 Iveco-Autokran Iveco Zeta Iveco Daily ",

            "text": "Kiton is an Italian fashion house founded by Ciro Paone in Naples in 1968. It is now one of the leading international companies operating in the luxury goods sector, and is renowned for its bespoke service (creating a tailored suit which is hand cut and basted) and ready-to-wear men and women\u2019s garments for the tailored collections. The Kiton brand was set up by Ciro Paone at Arzano, in the province of Naples, in 1968. The company philosophy celebrates the paramount importance of high quality: \u201cthe best of the best +1\u201d represents the motto that accompanies the company throughout the world. The name Kiton derives from \"chiton\", the ceremonial tunic worn by the ancient Greeks to pray to the gods of Olympus[1]. As the upholder of timeless elegance, Kiton is a byword for excellence due to the care and passion which lie behind the creation of all its garments, each of which is handmade. The needle and thread are the tools used by Kiton tailors who skilfully create unique products enhanced by the highest quality fabrics, such as yarns of pure vicu\u00f1a, cashmere, precious wools and silks. The world of Kiton rests on a twofold aim: to draw on the strong points of the hallowed tradition of Neapolitan tailoring, with a vision that is open to the world and to focus on the future. The constant innovation in terms of style, fabrics, manufacturing processes and company organisation and in the training of future tailors (Kiton School of Advanced Tailoring) all contribute to making Kiton a unique company. With five company-owned manufacturing sites, all situated in Italy, and about 800 employees, of whom over half are artisans, Kiton has managed to expand at a constant rate, consolidating its presence by selling its products in 73 countries, with over 50 monobrand stores.\t Kiton has complete control over its supply chain which consists of five factories all owned by the company: coats and jackets, shirts, ties, shoes and small leather goods are made at Arzano, the company\u2019s headquarters; leather jackets and bomber jackets are made at Collecchio, knitwear is made at Fidenza, jeans are made at Marcianise (province of Caserta), while fabrics are processed and created at Biella, the company\u2019s own woollen mill. The Kiton suit is a harmonious set of exclusive elements, the end result of a passion for beauty and elegant dressing which has always been the aim of Ciro Paone: the fabrics, manufacturing processes and accessories merge into a single item. Kiton creations are the expression of the technique and tradition of the much-vaunted tradition of Neapolitan tailoring, stripped of its eccentric \u201cexcesses\u201d, and have acquired an international reputation as icons of class and style. Craftsmanship is an art, the result of method and dedication.  For Kiton, the creation of a bespoke suit means, first and foremost, trying to ensure that it becomes the perfect expression of the wearer; the suits are cut and basted by hand to enhance attention to detail; any other approach would be unthinkable if the aim is to achieve an excellent result.  Everything in the world of Kiton revolves around the quality of the fabrics, a source of inspiration and motive for research that tells the company\u2019s own story of style for each different season.  In 2009 Kiton bought the \u201cCarlo Barbera\u201d woollen mill in Biella which has a long tradition of creating the highest quality woollen fabrics.   The woollen mill was set up in 1949 in a territory renowned for centuries for its textiles and is still one of the very few mills capable of producing fine fabrics.  The passion, knowledge of raw materials, experience of hand-crafted products and talent for making fabrics handed down from father to son are the distinctive elements which, combined with Kiton\u2019s research and innovation, make it possible to work with extraordinarily delicate fibres such as vic\u0169na, and to obtain unique yarns, dyes and weaves. The value of Kiton excellence is not restricted exclusively to production. In 2000 the Neapolitan company launched a training project with the foundation of the School of Advanced Tailoring[2], a strategic bridge to the future which, by combining a farsighted approach and necessity, is geared to training new generations of highly qualified tailors. Kiton has devised a three-year course with two main aims: to train young people so that they can enter the labour market, and to ensure the constant renewal of the labour force to guarantee Kiton\u2019s future and to keep the tradition of Neapolitan tailoring alive; the success of the initiative is reflected by the figures related to placements: 80% of the trainees who have gained a diploma have found work either at Kiton or at third parties.

            "text": "La Perla is an Italian luxury lifestyle company owned by German entrepreneur Lars Windhorst through Sapinda Group.[1] Founded by couturi\u00e8re Ada Masotti in Bologna in 1954, La Perla is one of few historical fashion houses with a woman founder.[2] Ada Masotti was trained as a corset-maker.[3] The current Creative Director of La Perla is Alessandra Bertuzzi who joined La Perla in 1987. La Perla was founded by master corsetmaker Ada Masotti in 1954 in Bologna, Italy, where the tradition of silk factories and textile manufacturing dates back to the 17th Century.[2][4] While working in a local atelier, she was given the nickname \u201cgolden scissors\u201d for her exacting cutting and tailoring abilities.[4] Over time, Ada Masotti adapted her corset expertise to different kinds of lingerie, inventing styles and redefining how lingerie was considered and worn.[4] The Masotti family redefined lingerie as a clothing accessory.[4] Ada Masotti would drape fabric directly on the female body, achieving expert awareness of line and movement.[4] Beginning in the 1950s, when female silhouettes were accentuated in fashion, Ada Masotti sought materials from Italian and international production such as Leavers lace woven on Calais looms, called Dentelle de Calais,  and tulle embroidered in northern Italy and Switzerland.[5] To adapt to the bright fashion statements of the 1960s, La Perla launched a lingerie line based on colorful, floral and checked patterns alongside the more traditional white, black and nude. In the 1970s, La Perla introduced the silk jersey triangle bra, which allowed for free-flowing movement and reflected fashion\u2019s preference for a smaller bust. In 1978, La Perla launched its stretch lace sets, echoing the fashion of the day with its clinging dresses and natural flowing lines. During the mid-1960s, the founder decided to launch the first collections of bikinis and swimsuits. During the underwear boom that characterized the 1980s fashion scene the company started its international expansion under the guidance of Alberto Masotti, the founder's son. Alberto Masotti\u2019s wife, Olga Masotti, was hired by Ada Masotti as a designer in 1972. In 1983 La Perla introduced the under-jacket, a lingerie item designed to be visible under the suiting of the era.[citation needed] Ada Masotti also created La Perla Maison, a collection featuring a range of garments in pure silk satin with embroidered inserts and frastaglio finishing, employing a technique that to this day is carried out by hand by the artisans of the La Perla atelier.[6] In 1994 La Perla launched the Sculpture bra that introduced a new way of thinking about underwear: elegance was no longer the exclusive prerogative of materials like lace and tulle, but represented by creations with harmonious styling, made of smooth and soft fabrics.[7] In 2000, Steinunn Sigurdard\u00f3ttir became the Creative Director of La Perla Ready to Wear. She introduced new fabrics and a swimsuit range.[8] To celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2004, La Perla put together a collection made with Valenciennes lace, produced on ancient mechanic looms of Calais, the most important Leavers lace centre in the world.[5] In 2006 actor Daniel Craig wore in the 007 Casino Royale movie a pair of Grigioperla swimming trunks and this garment became a favourite in the La Perla boutiques worldwide.[9] In 2012 Christie\u2019s organized a special auction celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first Bond film and the La Perla trunks were sold for \u00a344,450.[9] La Perla launched the Cage Bustier in 2007 worn by Victoria Beckham in the video of \u201cHeadlines\", the Spice Girls' reunion song. A capsule Cage collection was later launched, including the Cage top which received critical acclaim when worn by Beyonc\u00e9 for her 2014 Grammy Awards performance.[10][11] In 2011 La Perla began a collaboration with French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier.[12] That same year, La Perla entered the shapewear sector with ShapeCouture, which featured distinctive tailored cuts, tulle inserts and openwork finishes.[13] In June 2013 Italian entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia and Pacific Global Management purchased La Perla at auction.[14] Following the acquisition, the company was relaunched with a new development strategy. In the same year, La Perla launched the Made to Measure line, available in La Perla's major flagship stores.[4] The service is dedicated to a select few exclusive creations, which become one-of-a-kind as they are made to measure, sewn by hand, personalized with an embroidered monogram, and made precious by embroidery in gold thread.[4][15] The creations are only available by order.[4] La Perla\u2019s first Atelier collection showed during Couture Fashion Week in Paris in 2015, the brand\u2019s first runway show in Paris.[16] The designs for the collection took more than 14 months to sew by hand.[16] The show was staged at the H\u00f4tel Salomon de Rothschild and the pieces displayed at the La Perla boutique in Paris on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9. Top supermodels Naomi Campbell, Isabeli Fontana, Natasha Poly, and Lindsey Wixson joined Spring/Summer 2015 campaign stars Izabel Goulart, Sigrid Agren, and Ming Xi amongst the international models in the catwalk show.[17] La Perla lingerie is known for its corsetry and detailing. La Perla\u2019s notable technique and materials include frastaglio appliqu\u00e9 technique, Leavers lace and embroidered tulle.[18]. One of the latest additions in La Perla range is La Perla Second Skin lingerie line launched in 2018. The line features seamless laser-cut underwear.[19] Ada Masotti made the foray into women's beachwear in 1965, launching the first collections of bikinis and swimsuits. La Perla produces nightwear with the same materials and colours of its lingerie collections.  In 1985, the company extended its production to men's underwear and beachwear.[20] In June 2014, La Perla held the first menswear catwalk show at Pitti Uomo in Florence, presenting the new concept men's loungewear and Beachwear collection.[20] The collection included raffia robes, kimono-inspired gilets, and slim-cut swimming trunks.[20]  The company also produces accessories lines. Current Creative Director Julia Haart has been designing shoes and bags collection since Spring/Summer 2016.[20] The company expanded into perfume with their first fragrance, named simply La Perla, in 1986.[21] A fragrance for men, named Grigioperla, was released in 1993.[21] The bottles were created by designer Pierre Dinand.[21] The company was led by founder Ada Masotti from 1954 to 1981. Her son Alberto Masotti, who, after earning a degree in Medicine from the University of Bologna decided to completely dedicate himself to the family business, led the company from 1981 to 2007. In October 2008, La Perla was sold to JH Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm established in 1986 and focused on investments in services companies and luxury brands.[14] In June 2013 entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia and Pacific Global Management purchased La Perla at auction for \u20ac69 million ($90 million).[14] Pacific Global Management (PGM) also includes Elite Model Management and Women Management.[22] Following the acquisition, the company was relaunched with a development strategy aimed at consolidating the identity of the brand. In February 2018 Sapinda Group of Lars Windhorst acquired La Perla.[23] Julia Haart was appointed Creative Director of La Perla in 2016, after working with the brand on accessories collaborations for two seasons.[20] Haart's first collection, for Spring/Summer 2017, will present La Perla's women\u2019s ready-to-wear offering.[20]  La Perla sells its collections through a network of more than 150 flagship boutiques, both owned and franchised, in major cities around the world. The first La Perla boutiques opened internationally in 1991. It also has a presence in the main department stores and specialized shops. In 2014, Italian architecture studio Baciocchi Associati, who did interiors for Miu Miu and Prada boutiques, redesigned the interiors concept for La Perla global flagships. The new design concept was adopted in the existing flagship stores such as the historic boutiques of Sloane Street in London, via Montenapoleone in Milan and Madison Avenue in New York City as well as new boutiques such as the five-storey building in Old Bond Street in London, the boutique in Russell Street in Hong Kong and the building in Aoyama, Tokyo.[24] In 1997, collaborations with Italian photographer Marino Parisotto resulted in the publication of a photographic volume, Senso, portraying new La Perla styles.[25] Senso was dedicated to the world of corsetry seen through the female gaze.[25] In 2012, Rizzoli New York City published La Perla. Lingerie & Desire, the first monographic book dedicated to the brand and its evolution over almost sixty years. Some chapters are dedicated to the history of the La Perla products, marketing (the origins, the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s) and advertorial images, while others are linked to \"symbolic aesthetic concepts\" such as Black, White, Body, Inspirations, Precious and Eros.[26] The Spring/Summer 2014 campaign, shot by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott with art direction by Fabien Baron and styling by Ludivine Poiblanc, featured models Cara Delevingne, Liu Wen and Malgosia Bela. The three supermodels were chosen to represent the many facets of a woman's world \u2014 the guiding concept of the new La Perla advertising campaign for their Spring/Summer 2014 season. Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott under the artistic direction of Fabien Baron returned for the Fall/Winter 2014 campaign, whilst supermodels Mariacarla Boscono and Daria Strokous joined Spring/Summer 2014 protagonist Liu Wen. The campaign began with the debut of the new La Perla Made to Measure collection and the premiere of the exclusive backstage film.[27] The Spring/Summer 2015 campaign saw models Izabel Goulart, Sigrid Agren and Ming Xi lead as La Perla campaign stars, joined for the first time ever by a male protagonist \u2014 model Richard Biedul.[28] The Fall/Winter 2015 campaign marked the fourth consecutive season that La Perla teamed up with photographers Alas and Piggott as well as artistic director Baron. Top models Liu Wen, Natasha Poly and Isabeli Fontana appeared in the campaign wearing black lace. Spring/Summer 2016 introduced Italian model Mariacarla Boscono for the campaign, joining veterans Natasha Poly and Liu Wen. Fall/Winter 2016 continued the collaboration with Alas and Piggott, featuring Valery Kaufman, Sasha Luss and Liu Wen. The 2017 campaign featured Kendall Jenner, causing some controversy due to Jenner having to cancel a previously scheduled appearance as a Victoria's Secret model due to her new affiliation with La Perla.[29] ",

It operates eleven stores in Italy, including two flagship stores in Rome and one in Milan. In 1865, brothers Luigi and Ferdinando Bocconi opened in Via Santa Radegonda, Milan the first shop in Italy that sold ready-to-wear clothing and by the following year they employed over a hundred workers to manufacture ready-to-wear suits for men. Between 1872 and 1876, they set up branches in Via del Corso in Rome as well as in Genoa, Trieste, Palermo and Turin.  In 1877 they opened the department store Aux Villes d'Italie (\"To the Cities of Italy\") at the Hotel Comfortable. This was the first of its kind in Italy and conceived following the model of Aristide Boucicaut\u2019s store Le Bon March\u00e9 in Paris that \u00c9mile Zola made famous in his 1883-novel Au Bonheur des Dames.[citation needed] In 1880, the store took the Italianized name Alle citt\u00e0 d'Italia and in 1887 a new store designed by Giulio De Angelis opened in Rome in Piazza Colonna while in 1889 the new building of Piazza Duomo in Milan designed by Giovanni Giachi opened its doors. In 1917, Senator Borletti purchased the company from the Bocconi Brothers and commissioned poet Gabriele D'Annunzio to find a new name.  His suggestion was Rinascente, a name to convey the idea of \u2018rebirth\u2019 of the store. which was officially registered on 27 September 1917.[1] Borletti's objective was to turn elegance into the distinctive character of the department store by immediately committing himself to increasing the quality of the merchandise yet without excessively raising prices. The official goal was a \u201cdemocratic\u201d approach to luxury that would attract customers of both the high and middle-low income classes. Just a few days before the grand opening, on Christmas night of 1918 fire destroyed the store in Milan in Piazza Duomo. Between 1919 and 1920 the stores in Turin, Genoa, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples and Palermo were revamped. Over the years, other stores opened: Padua (1923), Catania (1923), Messina (1924), Bari (1925), Piazza Loreto in Milan, Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome, Taranto, Syracuse and Trapani (all between 1927 and 1928). The store in Piazza Duomo reopened on 23 March 1921 after it had been completely rebuilt, enlarged, transformed and expanded to include a variety of additional services such as a bank, a hair salon for women and men, a tearoom with an orchestra and a post office. The well-known poster created by Aldo Mazza for the reopening of the store, depicted a burnt trunk of an olive tree from with new green sprouting branches was a symbolic reference to the concept of rising from the ashes. Majority stakeholder Senator Borletti entrusted daily operation of the company to the hands of Umberto Brustio, his son-in-law. During these years Rinascente established and strengthened its business relationship with Marcello Dudovich. The Trieste-born artist would go on to create advertising posters for the company until 1956. In 1928, after collaborating with the German-based company Leonhard Tietz to introduce a store with fixed pricing in Italy, la Rinascente merged with UPIM to create a new company. This new enterprise had a new partner, namely the department store Jelmoli in Zurich, and consisted of 5 Rinascente and 25 UPIM stores around Italy. In 1937, the Piazza Colonna store in Rome installed the first escalator in a retail outlet in Italy. These were the years in which many Made in Italy products were launched and soon became popular all around. Prominence was given to synthetic fabrics such as rayon, cafioc (artificial hemp) and artificial wool, which all took centre stage. At this time Rinascente launched campaigns to promote products manufactured by Italian companies and created strong ties through its distribution network with consumers thus catering for the needs of the general public. After Senator Borletti\u2019s death of in 1939, Umberto Brustio was appointed president of the company. In 1941, the National Clothing Association declared la Rinascente as leader in the retail market since its sales area in square metres was double that of Standa and Coin put together. The following year the company celebrated its 25th anniversary and counted 5 Rinascente and 52 UPIM stores. The company suffered great losses during World War II. The stores in Genoa and Cagliari were completely destroyed. On August 16[when?], the store in Piazza Duomo was practically razed to the ground; only one Rinascente store in Rome and 37 UPIM stores around Italy were still partially operational. The City Council of Milan allowed la Rinascente to rent three large rooms in the Palazzo della Ragione in Via Mercanti so that it could keep supplying the general public with goods. After the war there was a rapid and vigorous recovery. Between 1945 and 1946 a rebuilding project included 19 UPIM stores, la Rinascente in Cagliari, the Head Office in Via Carducci, Milan as well as the warehousing facilities. On 4 December 1950, the Rinascente store in Piazza Duomo opened its doors once again in great style. The fa\u00e7ade of the building had been designed by Ferdinando Reggiori. Carlo Pagani was responsible for designing the store windows, entrances as well as the interior design and furnishings. Modern escalators connected the different floors of the building. Max Huber created the new logo while Albe Steiner was in charge of external and internal promotional fixtures and graphics until 1955. These were years of great turmoil and during this time Rinascente sold a great many innovative products imported mainly from the US and promoted a series of cultural events, which gave the public a glimpse of what was happening around the world. Countries featuring in these dedicated events included Spain (1955), Japan (1956), Great Britain (1957), the USA (1958) India and Thailand (1959), Mexico (1960) and a special event to promote the culture of the Indios in 1964. 1955 saw the inauguration of the new \u2018Circolo della Rinascente\u2019 located in Via Durini, Milan and the setting up of a PR office; while an office for market research was created in 1957. Lora Lamm was in charge of advertising graphics while Amneris Latis was the Art Director of the advertising department. In 1957, after 40 years, Umberto Brustio left his top management position and was nominated Honorary President. Aldo Borletti, Senator Borletti\u2019s son, was elected President and together with Cesare and Giorgio Bustio he also acted as Managing Director. One of the leading figures within top management was Cesare Bustio, Managing Director and Vice President. In 1954, Rinascente established the \u2018Compasso d\u2019Oro\u2019 award, the brainchild of Gio Ponti and Alberto Rosselli. This prize was awarded for the best industrial production and for those designers that in creating everyday objects knew how to combine aesthetics with functionality. Albe Steiner, who got the idea from one of his own work instruments, created the logo of the award while it was left to Alberto Rosselli and Marco Zanuso to design the actual compass given as prize.  In 1959, Rinascente gave control of the award to the Association for Industrial Design (ADI) that had been founded in 1956. In 1960, in addition to Rinascente-UPIM stores, the company expanded its operations by creating the Sma supermarkets chain. These stores followed the model of the first Italian supermarket, which opened in Milan in Viale Regina Giovanna on 27 November 1957. This was an example of more modern and advanced distribution and retailing of foodstuffs and groceries. It was the year of the economic boom and during the Christmas period there was such a great influx of customers that the Rinascente store in Milan was at times forced to block the entrances owing to overcrowding.[citation needed] Also in that year, Rinascente opened a new store designed by Franco Albini and Franca Helgin in Piazza Fiume, Rome. It extended over 7 floors linked by lifts, escalators and the famous spiral staircase designed by Albini. It held 50 sales departments displaying all the themes and ranges that so characterised the Milan branch. In this way, Rinascente became the most complete shopping destination in Rome.[according to whom?] In 1963, noted French fashion designer Pierre Cardin signed a contract with la Rinascente to create a line of moderately priced garments, declaring that the latest fashion pieces should be accessible to all, democratic and in step with the times.  Adriana Botti Monti became the Art Director of the Advertising department. Numerous prizes and professional awards marked her career. In 1967, after Aldo Borletti\u2019s death, the newly appointed president of the group was Senator Borletti (the son of one of the founder\u2019s brothers) and Cesare Brustio was the CEO. In 1969, the Borletti family sold its shareholdings to IFI and Mediobanca which held shares since 1965 when Jelmoli left the company. In 1970, the Ambassador Guido Colonna di Paliano was appointed president of the company. The group now owned 5 Rinascente stores, 150 UPIM stores and 54 Sma supermarkets. In 1972 Rinascente \u2013 Citt\u00e0 Mercato opened in Brescia as the first hypermarket selling at bargain prices. The aim of the new company\u2019s management was to overcome the contrast between the large retail sector and traditional retail. The retail outlet in Piazza Duomo was refurbished and the new organisation of Rinascente became more rational and in line with the times. In 1973, the company opened a new store in Turin. Umberto Brustio died on 25 April 1972 and Senator Borletti became Vice President on 23 March 1973. In 1977, the group acquired one of the largest American retailers: JC Penney with 4 stores in the Lombardy. Rinascente pushed for a bigger market share, sustained by all the experience in its retail network as well as a modern and successful business organisation. The result was a 20.7% increase in sales in the first semester.  In 1983 the group opened the first Italian Bricocenter, a DIY store, in Turin. Two years later the negotiations were successfully concluded for the purchase of Croff Nuova SpA, a company specialising in the distribution of homeware. In 1997 Fiat Estates stipulated a financial and technical agreement with Auchan, resulting in the gradual conversion of the 23 \u2018Citt\u00e0 Mercato\u2019 and the 2 \u2018Joyland\u2019 to the Auchan brand. The group closed with an increase in turnover and developed new strategies to reach the objective of strengthening the food sector by opening 40 hypermarkets by 2002. Following the split of the Group in 2005, the department stores of Rinascente were taken over by a group of investors (20% Pirelli Real Estate, 46% Associated Investors, 30% Deutsche Bank Real Estate, 4% Borletti family) and La Rinascente S.p.A. was set up. Vittorio Radice was at the helm of the management team.  This signaled the beginning of an important period of change: the aim being to reposition the brand upmarket thus increasing its value. This was achieved by means of restructuring and updating all stores and upgrading the type of products available The complete renovation of the store in Piazza Duomo included the addition of an extremely cosmopolitan Food Hall in 2007 and in 2009 the Design Supermarket taking up a whole floor with over 200 brands on display. In May 2011 the Thailand-based Central Retail Corporation, purchased Rinascente for \u20ac290 million.[2] Sudhitham Chirathivat became president with Tos Chirathivat as director of Rinascente. During a press conference Tos Chirathivat announced that he wanted to make the brand Rinascente famous at a global level and well\u2013known all over Asia. The following year Alberto Baldan, General Manager since 2007, was appointed CEO. Vittorio Radice took on the role of Vice President charged with the international development of the luxury stores within the group. In 2013, Central Group purchased department store ILLUM in Copenhagen and in 2015 it reached an agreement with Sigma for the acquisition of the majority shareholding of the KaDeWe Group thus acquiring the KaDeWe store in Berlin, Oberpollinger in Munich and Alsterhaus in Hamburg. On 26 May 2016 Rinascente Milan received the award as best department store in the world during the ceremony in Zurich of the Global Department Store Summit 2016.[3] LR100 stories of Innovation \u2013 an exhibition that celebrated 100 years of the brand Rinascente In 2017 la Rinascente set up an exhibition at Plazzo Reale in Milan to mark 100 years of the name invented by Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio. Design, fashion, art and communication played the star roles in an itinerary that showed how Rinascente created ever-new archetypes of tastes and trends and encouraged the introduction of new production methods for both the fashion and design industries. In September 2017 Rinascente revealed its new logo, all in upper case and without the definite article \u2018la\u2019. Graphics are by North Design, the British studio specialized in visual identity and the image is fresh and contemporary as befits the Rinascente Collection of stores. In October 2017, Rinascente opened a second Rome flagship store to its base. This new store occupies a refurbished 8-storey building in Via del Tritone, Rome. The most extraordinary feature is the archaeological site that can be visited on floor -1. The site brings to light the remains of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct dating back to 19 BC. The store also incorporates a small building dating back to the 1900s called the \u2018Palazzetto\u2019. The Food Hall, found on the top floor, gives visitors the chance to admire fantastic 360-degree views over the rooftops of the capital.  Originally scheduled to open in 2012, but was delayed several times.[4]  The store was in development and construction for 11 years and cost a total of \u20ac200 million.[5]  ",

            "text": "Lagostina is an Italian manufacturer of cookware, cutlery and other kitchenware. They are also an important manufacturer of pressure cookers. Lagostina was founded in 1901 in Omegna, Province of Verbania, Italy, as a family business initially focusing on stainless steel flatware. Lagostina was born in the Piedmont, in Omegna, on the shores of Lake Orta, a region famous for handcrafted household goods production, the company was founded by Carlo Lagostina and his son Emilio.  The metalcrafters gradually settled in this country where the economy was based mainly on wood, and contributed to the beginnings of industrial progress. The distribution of electric power, the development of railway network and the presence of a skilled workforce heavily impulsed the industrial boom.  Lagostina was created in 1901 and quickly became an expert in the manufacture of tinned iron flatware. In the early 30's, the flatware production reached up to 30 000 pieces per day and included among its main customers the Navy, Army and Aeronautics. Massimo Lagostina, grandnephew of the founder, launched the first stainless steel kitchen tools . This material, totally new for this purpose but already known for its aesthetic qualities and its robustness, enables Lagostina to express the Italian style art of living.  In 1929, at the Fair of Milan, Massimo saw the first stainless steel sheets. In the United States and Sweden, industrial production of this alloy began after a long period of studies and experiences . At that time the first products manufactured for the chemical and food industries were experimented. Massimo quickly understood that this material could also be used successfully in the field of kitchen tools.   In Italy, the first collection of stainless steel kitchenware was created in 1934 by Lagostina\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Casa Mia\u00a0\u00bb. The range bore the famous logo of \"the little house with smoking chimney\" and a met great success, immortalized in 1956 in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA).  At that time, selling steel pots and pans was not easy and Massimo faced the challenge to impose these new ranges. He made great efforts to make his new and much more expensive products accepted  on the market. The first customers were communities, hospitals, liners but also department stores such as La Rinascente in Milan. The first retailers were mainly located in the Piedmont and Lombardy.  Meanwhile, the rise of Lagostina continues through the manufacturing of technical parts for the aircraft industry until 1940. Indeed, demand for technical parts strongly increases during the War. The years 1956\u20131957 showed the end of tinned iron production. It was a turning point for Lagostina: the manufacturing process went from manual era to more mechanized manufacturing. The company established its own research and development laboratory in order to promote the development of innovative processes.  The industrial boom inexorably went ahead in 1955 with the launch of the first thermodiffusion base: Thermoplan, which provides excellent heat conductivity across the bottom of the product. 1960 marks the birth of the Lagostina pressure cooker, with its system of closure and openness so characteristic\u00a0: with a  lever and a flexible cover, the product is entirely made of stainless steel whereas in rest of Europe, this type of product is still made of aluminium. Thus a new plant and new office were built with the help of the architect Carlo Mazzeri, who had already participated as a designer to create the Moon Line handles and the kettle with Thermoplan base. Coming years dedicated to export, to Canada and particularly to France where a sales subsidiary was founded in 1967.  During those years, Lagostina kept on drawing attention by an innovative and humorous communication such as \"The Line\" (La Linea) created by Osvaldo Cavandoli. Lagostina became one of the first Italian companies to understand the importance of advertising. Other famous designers helped the brand to establish its awareness and strong personality. Thus, Giorgetto Giugiaro designed the \"Atmosphere\" pressure cooker and the \u00ab\u00a0Modia\u00a0\u00bb. This last part of the 20th century was characterized by a process of diversification of ranges. Indeed, over the years, Lagostina had adapted its production to changing culinary methods and flavors: in the 80\u2019s, a new function for the pressure cooker appears :the \"steam cooking\"; and the launch in 1986 of the \"Pastaoila\", a special pot to cook and drain pasta. Lagostina become a brand of Groupe SEB in 2004 and its positioning and identity are redefined in order to re-establish its high-end image. In 2009, Lagostina works jointly with the famous Swiss photographer Steeve Iuncker in order to pay homage to Italian women who cook,from generation to generation, the best pasta in the world. Lagostina publishes the book \u00ab\u00a0PASTA\u00a0\u00bb\u00a0: through a gallery of portraits, the reader gets to know Emanuela, Antonella, Lucia ... Modern Italian women who wished to share their culinary secrets under the lens of the photographer. Lagostina produces premium cookware features such as stoves, pots, pans, cast iron pots and tableware (services, flatware ...). Although labeled as Italian, their products are now made in China. Among the last innovations of the brand, there is \u00ab\u00a0Melodia Triply\u00a0\u00bb and, most of all, the new pressure cookers Domina and Maga with new open-close patented system \u00ab\u00a0Easy Opening\u00a0\u00bb. In 2009, Lagostina launches La Collezione Rossa, a worldwide innovation in the field of cookware. This collection is the result of a unique technological process (Steel&Color) allowing the fusion of steel with color . The collection was awarded by the famous prize Red Dot Design Award 2009. ",

            "text": "  Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[lambor\u02c8\u0261i\u02d0ni]) is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs  based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi. Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coup\u00e9, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent. Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Hurac\u00e1n along with the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing. Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy and continues to produce tractors. Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort. Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coup\u00e9, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and Ren\u00e9 Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle. The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 percent. As of the 2018 model year, Lamborghini's automobile product range consists of three model lines, two of which are mid-engine two-seat sports cars while the third one is a front engined, all-wheel drive SUV.[4] The V12-powered Aventador line consists of the LP 740\u20134 Aventador S coup\u00e9 and roadster.[5] The V10-powered Hurac\u00e1n line currently includes the all-wheel-drive LP 610-4 coup\u00e9 and spyder, the low cost rear-wheel-drive LP 580-2 coup\u00e9 and spyder and the most powerful, track oriented LP 640-4 Performant\u00e9 coup\u00e9 and spyder.[6] With the intention of doubling its sales volume by 2019, Lamborghini also added an SUV named Urus in its line-up which is powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine and utilises a front engine, all-wheel drive layout.[7][8] Motori Marini Lamborghini produces a large V12 marine engine block for use in World Offshore Series Class 1 powerboats. A Lamborghini branded marine engine displaces approximately 8,171\u00a0cc (8.2\u00a0L) and outputs approximately 940\u00a0hp (700\u00a0kW).[9] In the mid-1980s, Lamborghini produced a limited-production run of a 1,000\u00a0cc sports motorcycle. UK weekly newspaper Motor Cycle News reported in 1994 \u2013 when featuring an example available through an Essex motorcycle retailer \u2013 that 24 examples were produced with a Lamborghini alloy frame having adjustable steering head angle, Kawasaki GPz1000RX engine/transmission unit, Ceriani front forks and Marvic wheels. The bodywork was plastic and fully integrated with front fairing merged into fuel tank and seat cover ending in a rear tail-fairing. The motorcycles were designed by Lamborghini stylists and produced by French business Boxer Bikes.[10] Lamborghini licenses its brand to manufacturers that produce a variety of Lamborghini-branded consumer goods including scale models, clothing, accessories, bags, electronics[11] and laptop computers.[12] In contrast to his rival Enzo Ferrari, Ferruccio Lamborghini had decided early on that there would be no factory-supported racing of Lamborghinis, viewing motorsport as too expensive and too draining on company resources.[13] This was unusual for the time, as many sports car manufacturers sought to demonstrate the speed, reliability, and technical superiority through motorsport participation. Enzo Ferrari in particular was known for considering his road car business mostly a source of funding for his participation in motor racing. Ferruccio's policy led to tensions between him and his engineers, many of whom were racing enthusiasts; some had previously worked at Ferrari. When Dallara, Stanzani, and Wallace began dedicating their spare time to the development of the P400 prototype, they designed it to be a road car with racing potential, one that could win on the track and also be driven on the road by enthusiasts.[14] When Ferruccio discovered the project, he allowed them to go ahead, seeing it as a potential marketing device for the company, while insisting that it would not be raced. The P400 went on to become the Miura. The closest the company came to building a true race car under Lamborghini's supervision were a few highly modified prototypes, including those built by factory test driver Bob Wallace, such as the Miura SV-based \"Jota\" and the Jarama S-based \"Bob Wallace Special\". In the mid-1970s, while Lamborghini was under the management of Georges-Henri Rossetti, Lamborghini entered into an agreement with BMW to develop, then manufacture 400 cars for BMW in order to meet Group 4 homologation requirements. BMW lacked experience developing a mid-engined vehicle and believed that Lamborghini's experience in that area would make Lamborghini an ideal choice of partner. Due to Lamborghini's shaky finances, Lamborghini fell behind schedule developing the car's structure and running gear. When Lamborghini failed to deliver working prototypes on time, BMW took the program in house, finishing development without Lamborghini. BMW contracted with Baur to produce the car, which BMW named the M1, delivering the first vehicle in October 1978.[15][16] In 1985, Lamborghini's British importer developed the Countach QVX, in conjunction with Spice Engineering, for the 1986 Group C championship season. One car was built, but lack of sponsorship caused it to miss the season. The QVX competed in only one race, the non-championship 1986 Southern Suns 500\u00a0km race at Kyalami in South Africa, driven by Tiff Needell. Despite the car finishing better than it started, sponsorship could once again not be found and the programme was cancelled.[17] Lamborghini was an engine supplier in Formula One for the 1989 through 1993 Formula One seasons. It supplied engines to Larrousse (1989\u20131990,1992\u20131993), Lotus (1990), Ligier (1991), Minardi (1992), and to the Modena team in 1991. While the latter is commonly referred to as a factory team, the company saw themselves as a supplier, not a backer. The 1992 Larrousse\u2013Lamborghini was largely uncompetitive but noteworthy in its tendency to spew oil from its exhaust system. Cars following closely behind the Larrousse were commonly coloured yellowish-brown by the end of the race.[18] Lamborghini's best result was achieved with Larrousse at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, when Aguri Suzuki finished third on home soil.[19] In late 1991, a Lamborghini Formula One motor was used in the Konrad KM-011 Group C sports car, but the car only lasted a few races before the project was canceled. The same engine, re-badged a Chrysler, Lamborghini's then-parent company, was tested by McLaren towards the end of the 1993 season, with the intent of using it during the 1994 season. Although driver Ayrton Senna was reportedly impressed with the engine's performance, McLaren pulled out of negotiations, choosing a Peugeot engine instead, and Chrysler ended the project. Two racing versions of the Diablo were built for the Diablo Supertrophy, a single-model racing series held annually from 1996 to 1999. In the first year, the model used in the series was the Diablo SVR, while the Diablo 6.0 GTR was used for the remaining three years.[20][21] Lamborghini developed the Murci\u00e9lago R-GT as a production racing car to compete in the FIA GT Championship, the Super GT Championship and the American Le Mans Series in 2004. The car's highest placing in any race that year was the opening round of the FIA GT Championship at Valencia, where the car entered by Reiter Engineering finished third from a fifth-place start.[22][23] In 2006, during the opening round of the Super GT championship at Suzuka, a car run by the Japan Lamborghini Owners Club garnered the first victory (in class) by an R-GT. A GT3 version of the Gallardo has been developed by Reiter Engineering.[24] A Murci\u00e9lago R-GT entered by All-Inkl.com racing, driven by Christophe Bouchut and Stefan M\u00fccke, won the opening round of the FIA GT Championship held at Zhuhai International Circuit, achieving the first major international race victory for Lamborghini.[25] (key) (results in bold indicate pole position)  The world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity.[26][27][28] In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini, a Taurus himself, was so impressed by the majestic Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the automaker he would open shortly.[29] After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.[29][30] The automaker would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. Espada is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track.[31] After christening the Urraco after a bull breed, in 1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the Countach\u00a0(help\u00b7info) not for a bull,[32] but for contacc (pronounced\u00a0[k\u028a\u014b\u02c8t\u0251t\u0283]), a Piedmontese expletive.[32] Legend has it that stylist Nuccio Bertone uttered the word in surprise when he first saw the Countach prototype, \"Project 112\".[33] The LM002  (LM for Lamborghini Militaire) sport utility vehicle and the Silhouette (named after the popular racing category of the time) were other exceptions to the tradition. The Jalpa of 1982 was named for a bull breed; Diablo, for the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for fighting an epic battle against El Chicorro in Madrid in 1869;[34][35][36] Murci\u00e9lago, the legendary bull whose life was spared by El Lagartijo for his performance in 1879; Gallardo, named for one of the five ancestral castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed;[37] and Revent\u00f3n, the bull that defeated young Mexican torero F\u00e9lix Guzm\u00e1n in 1943. The Estoque concept of 2008 was named for the estoc, the sword traditionally used by matadors during bullfights.[38] Throughout its history, Lamborghini has envisioned and presented a variety of concept cars, beginning in 1963 with the very first Lamborghini prototype, the 350GTV. Other famous models include Bertone's 1967 Marzal, 1974 Bravo, and 1980 Athon, Chrysler's 1987 Portofino, the Italdesign-styled Cala from 1995, the Zagato-built Raptor from 1996. A retro-styled Lamborghini Miura concept car, the first creation of chief designer Walter de'Silva, was presented in 2006. President and CEO Stephan Winkelmann denied that the concept would be put into production, saying that the Miura concept was \"a celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about the future. Retro design is not what we are here for. So we won\u2019t do the [new] Miura.\u201d[39]  At the 2008 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the Estoque, a four-door sedan concept. Although there had been much speculation regarding the Estoque's eventual production,[40][41] Lamborghini management has not made a decision regarding production of what might be the first four-door car to roll out of the Sant'Agata factory.[42]At the 2010 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Sesto Elemento. The concept car is made almost entirely of carbon fibre making it extremely light, with a weight of 999\u00a0kg (2,202\u00a0lb). The Sesto Elemento shares the same V10 engine found in the Lamborghini Gallardo. Lamborghini hopes to signal a shift in the company's direction from making super cars focused on top speed to producing more agile, track focused cars with the Sesto Elemento. The concept car can reach 0\u201362\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) in 2.5 seconds and can reach a top speed of over 180\u00a0mph.[43] At the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Aventador J \u2013 a roofless, windowless version of the Lamborghini Aventador. The Aventador J uses the same 700\u00a0hp engine and seven-speed transmission as the standard Aventador.[44] At the 2012 Beijing Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Urus SUV. This is the first SUV built by Lamborghini since the LM002. As part of the celebration of 50 years of Lamborghini, the company created the Egoista. Egoista is for one person's driving and only one Egoista is to be made.[45] At the 2014 Paris Motor Show, Lamborghini unveiled the Asterion LPI910-4 hybrid concept car. Named after the half-man, half-bull hybrid (Minotaur) of Greek legend, it is the first hybrid Lamborghini in the history of the company. Utilizing the Hurac\u00e1n's 5.2 litre V10 producing 607\u00a0hp (453\u00a0kW; 615\u00a0PS), along with one electric motor mounted on the transaxle and an additional two on the front axle, developing an additional 300\u00a0hp (224\u00a0kW; 304\u00a0PS). This puts the power at a combined figure of 907\u00a0hp (676\u00a0kW; 920\u00a0PS). The 0\u2013100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) time is claimed to be just above 3 seconds, with a claimed top speed of 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h).[46] As of 2011, Lamborghini is structured as a wholly owned subsidiary of AUDI AG named Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.[Notes 1][47] Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. controls five principal subsidiaries: Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A., a manufacturer of motorcycles; Italdesign Giugiaro S.p.A., a 90.1%-owned design and prototyping firm that provides services to the entire Volkswagen Group; MML S.p.A. (Motori Marini Lamborghini), a manufacturer of marine engine blocks; and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A. (formerly Autogerma S.p.A.), which sells Audi and other Volkswagen Group vehicles in Italy.[47][48] By sales, the most important markets in 2004 for Lamborghini's sports cars were the U.S. (41%), Germany (13%), Great Britain (9%) and Japan (8%). Prior to the launch of the Gallardo in 2003, Lamborghini produced approximately 400 vehicles per year; in 2011 Lamborghini produced 1,711 vehicles.[49] Autom\u00f3viles Lamborghini Latinoam\u00e9rica S.A. de C.V. (Lamborghini Automobiles of Latin America Public Limited Company) is an authorized distributor and manufacturer of Lamborghini-branded vehicles and merchandise in Latin America and South America.[72] In 1995, Indonesian corporation MegaTech, Lamborghini's owner at the time, entered into distribution and license agreements with Mexican businessman Jorge Antonio Fernandez Garcia. The agreements give Autom\u00f3viles Lamborghini Latinoam\u00e9rica S.A. de C.V. the exclusive distributorship of Lamborghini vehicles and branded merchandise in Latin America and South America. Under the agreements, Autom\u00f3viles Lamborghini is also allowed to manufacture Lamborghini vehicles and market them worldwide under the Lamborghini brand.[72] Autom\u00f3viles Lamborghini has produced two rebodied versions of the Diablo called the Eros and the Coatl. In 2015, Autom\u00f3viles Lamborghini transferred the IP-rights to the Coatl foundation (chamber of commerce no. 63393700) in The Netherlands in order to secure these rights and to make them more marketable.[73] The company has announced the production of a speedboat called the Lamborghini Glamour.[74] This two-storey museum is attached to the headquarters, and covers the history of Lamborghini cars and sport utility vehicles, showcasing a variety of modern and vintage models. The museum uses displays of cars, engines and photos to provide a history and review important milestones of Lamborghini. A 9,000 square-foot museum about Ferruccio Lamborghini houses several cars, industrial prototypes, sketches, personal objects and family photos from Ferruccio's early life.[75] ",

            "text": "Lambretta is the brand name of a line of motor scooters initially manufactured in Milan, Italy, by Innocenti. The name is derived from the word Lambrate, the suburb of Milan named after the river which flows through the area, and where the factory was located. Lambretta was the name of a mythical water-sprite associated with the river which runs adjacent to the former production site.[1][2] In 1972, the Indian government bought the machinery of the Milanese factory, creating Scooters India Limited (SIL) in order to produce the Lambro three-wheeler under the name Vikram for the domestic market.  Lambretta scooters were also manufactured under licence by Fenwick in France, NSU in Germany, Serveta in Spain, API in India, Yulon in Taiwan, Pasco in Brazil, Auteco in Colombia and Siambretta in Argentina. Innocenti S.A.  (also known as Lambretta Consortium) based in Lugano, Switzerland is the owner of the international trademark Lambretta and has licensed the brand throughout the world. In 1922, Ferdinando Innocenti of Pescia built a steel-tubing factory in Rome. In 1931, he took the business to Milan where he built a larger factory producing seamless steel tubing and employing about 6,000. The factory was heavily bombed and destroyed during World War II. It is said that, when surveying the ruins, Innocenti saw the future of cheap, private transport and decided to produce a motor scooter, competing on cost and weather protection against the ubiquitous motorcycle. The main stimulus for the design style of the Lambretta and Vespa dates back to pre-World War II Cushman scooters made in Nebraska, United States. These olive green scooters were in Italy in large numbers, ordered originally by the United States military as field transport for the paratroops and marines. The United States military had used them to get around German defence tactics of destroying roads and bridges in the Dolomites (a section of the Alps) and the Austrian border areas. Aeronautical engineer General Corradino D'Ascanio, responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by Agusta, was given the job by Ferdinando Innocenti of designing a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. It had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger and not get its driver's clothes soiled. D'Ascanio, who hated motorbikes, introduced many changes to his vehicle. It was built on a spar frame with a handlebar gear change and the engine mounted directly onto the rear wheel. The front protection \"shield\" kept the rider dry and clean in comparison to the open front end on motorcycles. The pass-through leg area design was geared towards women, as wearing dresses or skirts made riding conventional motorcycles a challenge. The front fork, like an aircraft's landing gear, allowed for easy wheel changing. The internal mesh transmission eliminated the standard motorcycle chain, a source of oil and dirt. This basic design allowed a series of features to be deployed on the frame which would later allow quick development of new models. However, D'Ascanio fell out with Innocenti, who rather than a stamped spar frame wanted to produce his frame from rolled tubing, allowing him to revive both parts of his pre-war company. D'Ascanio disassociated himself from Innocenti and took his design to Enrico Piaggio who produced the spar-framed Vespa from 1946 on. The final design of the Lambretta was done by aeronautical engineers Cesare Pallavicino and Pier Luigi Torre. Pallavicino had been Technical Director at the Caproni airplane factory during World War II before working on the Lambretta design. Torre was an engine designer at Italo Balbo's Idros; he designed the engine and organized Innocenti's factory for mass production.[3][4][5] Arriving on the market the following year, the 1947 Lambretta featured a rear pillion seat for a passenger or optionally a storage compartment. The original front protection \"shield\" was a flat piece of aero metal; later this developed into a twin skin to allow additional storage behind the front shield, similar to the glove compartment in a car. The fuel cap was underneath the hinged seat, which saved the cost of an additional lock on the fuel cap or need for additional metal work on the smooth skin. The name Lambretta was derived from a mythical water-sprite associated with the Lambrate river which also gives it name to the Lambrate area of Milan where the factory was located.[1][2] Innocenti started production of Lambretta scooters in 1947, the year after Piaggio started production of its Vespa models. Lambrettas were manufactured under licence in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India and Spain, sometimes under other names, but always to a recognizable design, e.g. Siambretta in South America and Serveta in Spain. American retailer Montgomery Ward imported the Lambretta Li125 and sold it via their catalog under the Riverside captive import brand.[6] The French importer of Lambretta, one Henri Willame, also started a company selling imported microcars under the catch-all \"Willam\" label. Many of these creations received Lambretta engines, and were sold through the French Lambretta network.[7] Certain minicars, such as the 123\u00a0cc \"Lambretta Lisa\" (built by DECSA in San Marino) were sold primarily with \"Lambretta\" badging.[8] The four-wheeled version of the Casalini Sulky was sold as the Willam Bretta in France, beginning in 1980.[7][9] As wealth increased in western Europe in the late 1960s, the demand for motor scooters fell as the small car became affordable to more people and Lambretta sales started to decline, as did the financial status of parent company Innocenti. The British Leyland Motor Corporation took advantage of Innocenti's financial difficulties and their production and engineering expertise and contracted Innocenti to produce cars under licence from BLMC. The Innocenti Mini used the mechanical components of the original, but was in many ways superior to it. Innocenti was eventually sold to BLMC. Unfortunately, lack of foresight had caused BLMC to join a fashion trend that was ending rapidly. Long industrial strikes in BLMC ensued; motor-scooter sales declined sharply, and Innocenti finally closed shop in 1972. Scooter sales in many of Lambretta's export markets, such as India and Indonesia dropped precipitously as light Japanese motorcycles replaced scooters.[7] As of 2017, The Lambretta Consortium has re-launched the \"Lambretta V-Special\" model. The Indian government bought the factory for essentially the same reasons that Ferdinando Innocenti had built it after the war. India was a country with poor infrastructure, economically not ready for small private cars yet with a demand for private transport. Automobile Products of India (API) began assembling Innocenti-built Lambretta scooters in India after independence in the 1950s beginning with 48 cc, Ld model, Li 1st series. They eventually acquired a licence to build the Li150 Series 2 model, which was sold under the Lambretta name until about 1976 and later on changed the name to Lamby for legal reasons. They also for sometime made and sold Lambretta TV 175 series under the name of Mac 175. Scooter India Ltd acquired the entire Innocenti Unit in 1972. API also built the trademark model [API-175] three-wheeler which was based on Innocenti's Lambro. API continued to build Lambretta-derived models until the 1990s but have been non-operational since 1993. In 1972, Scooters India Ltd. (SIL) a state-run enterprise based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, bought the entire Lambretta manufacturing and trademark rights. Former Innocenti employees were used to set up an Indian factory as all the manuals and machinery instructions were in Italian.  The first scooter built was the Vijay Delux/DL, which was badged the Lambretta GP150 in export markets.  This  was later enhanced to become the Vijay Super.  Further improvements were made in the final years of production by incorporating a contemporary Japanese CDI unit and an advanced front suspension. SIL also distributed complete knock downs that were assembled in different parts of India and sold as the Allwyn Pusphak, Falcon, and Kesri.  These were of a lower quality than the SIL-produced models and sometimes incorporated significant styling changes. SIL production seems to have peaked during the financial year 1980\u201381, with around 35,000 scooters being built.  However, by 1987 this had dropped to around 4,500 units with production finally ceasing in 1997.  As of 2017, SIL's production now centres on the Vikram three-wheeler, powered by the Lambretta engine.  As of 2017, SIL produces limited spares for the GP/DL range of scooters. As of 2010, The Lambretta Consortium has filed a suite against SIL (Scooters India Limited) for nonusage of the Lambretta Brand, seeking to reclaim the Lambretta brand name.[10][11] There are still clubs across the world, both national and local clubs, devoted to the Lambretta scooter. The clubs still participate and organize ride outs and rallies which regularly take place during weekends over the summer months and have high attendance, some rallies achieve 2,500 paying rally goers.  Across the UK there are many privately owned scooter shops which deal with everything Lambretta, from sales, services, parts, tuning, performance and complete nut and bolt restorations. In Brazil, \"lambreta\" is used as a synonym for \"scooter\", being listed at the Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa, one of the country\u2019s main dictionaries, as a noun/substantive. The small village of Rodano, near Milan, hosts the biggest Lambretta museum in Europe and the Innocenti archives. In the collection are also several non-Lambretta scooters, including some first models from the 1910s and US Army scooters parachuted over Normandy in 1944. In Weston-super-Mare, England, there was a Lambretta Scooter Museum which housed a total of 61 Lambretta models\u00a0\u2013 at least one from each year between October 1947 through May 1971. It also housed a large amount of Lambretta memorabilia. This museum and collection was sold in early 2007 and re-opened on 8 August 2008 following refurbishment. It has subsequently closed. In 1997 the UK-based Lambretta Clothing brand of clothing and accessories was founded. The company is currently part of Lambretta Consortium. Like Vespas of the day, Lambrettas had three or four gears and two-stroke engines with capacities ranging from 49\u00a0cc to 198\u00a0cc.  Most two-stroke engines require a mixture of oil with the gasoline in order to lubricate the piston and cylinder. Unlike the Vespa, which was built with a unibody chassis pressed from sheets of steel, Lambrettas featured a more rigid tubular frame, although the Cento (produced 1964-1965) & \"J\" range models (produced 1964-1970) did have a monocoque body.  Early versions were available in \"closed\", with fully covered mechanicals or \"open\", with minimal panels and thus looking like an unusual motorcycle. The model A and model B were only available in \"open\" style. The D models were noted for their torsion-bar rear suspension; at its peak, the D model outsold all other two-wheeled vehicles combined. (For the latter, see Ruth Orkin's famous photograph American Girl in Italy.) The much greater success of the \"closed\" version confirmed that riders wanted protection from the weather and a clean-looking machine. Along with the Vespa, Lambretta was an iconic vehicle of the 1950s and 1960s when they became the adopted vehicle of choice for the UK youth-culture known as Mods.  The character Jimmy from the influential scooter movie Quadrophenia rode a Lambretta Li 150 Series 3.  Of the 1960s models, the TV (Turismo Veloce), the Special (125 and 150), the SX (Special X) and the GP (Grand Prix) are generally considered the most desirable due to their increased performance and refined look; the \"matte black\" fittings on the GP model are said to have influenced European car designs throughout the 1970s. These three models came with a front disc brake made by Campagnolo. The TV was the world's first production two-wheeled vehicle with a front disc brake. As the race to be the first person on the moon gathered pace, Innocenti's new model was launched, the Luna range (Luna meaning \"moon\", in Italian). The machines looked very advanced for their day, reverting to the open frame style of the much admired \"D\" types, and although sales were slow to start with, racing success from grass-tracking to circuit-racing soon made them a sales success. Designed by Bertone Innocenti wanted a small frame and engine Lambretta that could be sold alongside the larger models. The frame had a tubular-steel front end, with bolt-on leg shields, and a monocoque pressed-steel rear frame. Lambrettas have attracted an eclectic following of \"revival\" Mods, collectors, scooterists, cutdown enthusiasts, and even racers.  Vespa and Lambrettas both can be converted to fun and relatively fast machines with little (but relatively expensive) modification.  Many owners customize these scooters with elaborate customizations and paintwork and attend well-organised scooter rallies. The Lambretta has benefitted from advances in technology in the motorcycle world. To boost performance some owners have fitted aftermarket cylinders and crankshafts that increase the swept volume to as much as 250\u00a0cc. Common modifications include a Nikasil plated aluminium barrel with radical porting, large Dell'Orto or Mikuni carburettors and bespoke expansion chambers. Hydraulic disc brakes in the front are becoming common on the more highly tuned machines, as are hydraulic clutches and rear brakes. Modern low-profile tyres greatly improve handling, as do uprated front and rear suspension units.

            "text": "Lancia (Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8lant\u0283a]) is an Italian automobile manufacturer founded in 1906 by Vincenzo Lancia as Lancia & C.. It became part of the Fiat Group in 1969; the current company, Lancia Automobiles, was established in 2007. The company has a strong rally heritage and is noted for using letters of the Greek alphabet for its model names. Lancia vehicles are no longer sold outside Italy and comprise only the Ypsilon supermini range, as the late Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne foreshadowed in January 2014 until his death in 2018.[1] Lancia & C. Fabbrica Automobili was founded on 29 November 1906 in Turin by Fiat racing drivers, Vincenzo Lancia (1881-1937) and his friend, Claudio Fogolin (1872-1945).  The first car manufactured by Lancia was the \"Tipo 51\" or \"12 HP\" (later called \"Alfa\"), which remained in production from 1907 to 1908. It had a small four-cylinder engine with a power output of 28\u00a0PS (21\u00a0kW; 28\u00a0hp).[3] In 1910, Lancia components were exported to the United States where they were assembled and sold as SGVs by the SGV Company.[4] In 1915, Lancia also manufactured its first truck, the Jota that continued as a dedicated series. In 1937, Vincenzo died of a heart attack and both his wife, Adele Miglietti Lancia, and his son, Gianni Lancia, took over control of the company. They persuaded Vittorio Jano to join as an engineer. Jano had already made a name for himself by designing various Alfa Romeo models, including some of its most successful race cars ever such as the 6C, P2 and P3. Lancia is renowned in the automotive world for introducing cars with numerous innovations. These include the Theta of 1913, which was the first European production car to feature a complete electrical system as standard equipment.[5] Lancia's first car adopting a monocoque chassis \u2013 the Lambda produced from 1922 to 1931 - featured 'Sliding Pillar' independent front suspension that incorporated the spring and hydraulic damper into a single unit (a feature that would be employed in subsequent Lancia's, up to the Appia that was replaced in 1963). 1948 saw the first 5 speed gearbox to be fitted to a production car (Series 3 Ardea). Lancia premiered the first full-production V6 engine, in the 1950 Aurelia,[6] after earlier industry-leading experiments with V8 and V12 engine configurations. It was also the first manufacturer to produce a V4 engine. Other innovations involved the use of independent suspension in production cars (in an era where live axles were common practice for both the front and rear axles of a car) and rear transaxles, which were first fitted to the Aurelia and Flaminia range. This drive for innovation, constant quest for excellence, fixation of quality, complex construction processes and antiquated production machinery meant that all cars essentially had to be hand-made. With little commonality between the various models, the cost of production continued to increase extensively, while no increase in demand eventually affecting Lancia's viability.[citation needed] Gianni Lancia, a graduate engineer, was president of Lancia from 1947 to 1955. In 1956 the Pesenti family took over control of Lancia with Carlo Pesenti (1907\u20131984) in charge of the company.[7] Fiat launched a take-over bid in October 1969 which was accepted by Lancia as the company was losing significant sums of money, with losses in 1969 being GB\u00a320m.[8]  This was not the end of the distinctive Lancia marque, and new models in the 1970s such as the Stratos, Gamma and Beta served to prove that Fiat wished to preserve the image of the brand it had acquired. During the 1970s and 1980s, Lancia had great success in rallying, winning many World Rally Championships. During the 1980s, the company cooperated with Saab Automobile, with the Lancia Delta being sold as the Saab 600 in Sweden. The 1985 Lancia Thema also shared a platform with the Saab 9000, Fiat Croma and the Alfa Romeo 164. During the 1990s, all models were closely related to other Fiat models. Starting from 1 February 2007, Fiat's automotive operations were reorganised.[9] Fiat Auto became Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A., Fiat S.p.A.'s branch handling mainstream automotive production. Simultaneously the current company, Lancia Automobiles S.p.A., was created from the pre-existing brand, and controlled 100% by FGA.[9] In 2011, Lancia moved in a new direction and added new models manufactured by Chrysler and sold under the Lancia badge in many European markets. Conversely, Lancia built models began to be sold in right-hand drive markets under the Chrysler badge. In 2015 Lancia's parent company Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. became FCA Italy S.p.A., reflecting the earlier incorporation of Fiat S.p.A. into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. From 1907 to 1910 Lancia cars didn't bear a true badge, but rather a brass plaque identifying the manufacturer (Lancia & C.) and chassis code; although some models did have a brass Lancia script on the grille.[10] The original Lancia logo was designed by Count Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia. In 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia to design a badge for the company; the Count submitted six watercolour proposal sketches. Vincenzo Lancia chose a round one, composed by a blue lance and flag bearing a Lancia script (\"Lancia\" means \"lance\" in Italian) in gold, over a four-spoke steering wheel, with a hand throttle detail on the right spoke.[10] The first car to bear the Lancia logo was the Gamma 20 HP in 1911.[10] In 1929 the logo acquired its final layout: the previous round badge was superimposed on a blue shield in the shape of a Reuleaux triangle (as found in one of Biscaretti di Ruffia's six original proposals).[10] Though first applied on the 1929 Dikappa, this badge was only used consintently starting with the 1936 Aprilia.[10] Beginning with the 1957 Flaminia, Lancia cars switched from the traditional vertical split grille to an horizontal, full-width one. The logo was therefore moved inside the grille opening, and changed to a more stylized chromed metal open-work design; shield and steering wheel became chrome frames, the only remaining enameled surface being the blue field of the flag. This new metal logo was used on most models with some exceptions, namely Zagato-bodied Lancia Fulvias and Flavias, the Lancia 2000 Berlina (which reprised the traditional upright grille and the round enameled badge) and the Stratos HF (whose ornaments lacked the triangular shield). In 1974 the badge was redesigned on Gianni Agnelli's request;[10] it went back to a modernised silver, white and blue version of the 1929 design. Flag and lance were unified in a single shape and dispensed with the earlier minute detailing, the Lancia letters became all of the same size, and the steering wheel became also outlined in blue and lost the hand throttle detail. This logo debuted on the 1979 Lancia Delta,[10] and made its way on the other models as they adopted the split grille introduced by the Delta. Though lightly revised in 2000 with the addition of a chrome shield surround, the 1974 logo was used through four decades, up to 2006. The current logo, designed by Robilant Associati, was presented at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show\u2014a couple of months after the creation of Lancia Automobiles.[10] While the traditional chrome-framed blue shield has been retained and made three-dimensional, for the first time since 1911 lance and flag are absent; the steering wheel has been stylized into a chromed circle, from which two spikes converge towards the modern Lancia logotype in the centre. Cavalier Giuseppe Lancia (1860 (Cuneo) - 1919 (Bordighera)) was an Italian businessman and father of Vincenzo Lancia. When he was sixteen he started a business with food in Italy. Later, for a few years, he made relationships with South America and he created a food industry in Argentina. His efforts and innovations made his company a great success. His company was one of the first food companies in the country and showed new methods in this sector. When he made a fortune he returned to Italy. By his education Giuseppe is a translator. In 1875, he married Marianna Orazzi. In 1876, their first son Giovanni was born. In 1879 their daughter Margherita was born. Unfortunately, she died in 1894. In 1881 their third child Vincenzo Lancia was born. Their second daughter, Anna Maria (later Anna-Maria-Giacobinni), was born in 1884. The Lancia family at that time was important for Turin. The members of the family liked to go on opera and theatre. In their free time. the Lancias  spend their time at a villa  near Turin. Vincenzo Lancia was born on 24 of August 1881 in Fobello near Turin. His father wanted Vincenzo to be a lawyer, but didn't have much interest in the humanities. He met the Battista brothers as well as Giovanni Ceirano and became interested in science and technology, especially automobiles. He saw his first cars in Turin and Milan. One of his friends Carlo Bishareti di Ruffia had a Benz and that was the first important automobile in his life. When FIAT was founded in 1899 Vincenzo was very active in the company and later became one of the most famous test drivers of Italian automobile brands. In 1922, Vincenzo married his secretary - Adele Miglietti. Vincenzo and Adele had three children Gianni, Eleonora and Maria. He died on February 15, 1937. Gianni Lancia  was born on 24 November 1924 in Turin. He finished his education with his sisters at the Technical University of Pisa. From the time he was a little boy Gianni loved sports, but his greatest passion was motor racing. This led him to become a driver for the Lancia team. Gianni became the boss of Lancia in 1950. Unfortunately, he invested a lot of money in expensive prototypes and other unprofitable ventures that led him to sell a big part of the company to Carlo Pesenti in 1957. After that he started a business in the food industry. For a few years he lived in Brazil. He had two sons, Mariele and Vincenzo from his first marriage and had one son (Lorenzo Lancia) from his marriage to Jacqueline Sassard. He died on 30 June 2014. The Ypsilon is a premium 5-door supermini car produced since 2011. It is based on an updated Fiat 500 platform. Available for sale in various European markets, for the United Kingdom and Ireland it was only sold as the Chrysler Ypsilon.[11] The Lancia Aurelia introduced the front engine rear transmission configuration later used by Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Porsche, GM, and Maserati, as well as the V6 engine, which is now common. It also had inboard rear brakes, an important way of reducing un-sprung weight. The Lancia Stratos was a successful rally car during the 1970s and helped the company to improve its sporting credentials. The Lancia Thema executive car was a re-branded second generation Chrysler 300 unveiled in 2011 to replace the Thesis. It re\u2013used the name of the Italian made 1984\u201394 Thema saloon. Previously available in various European markets, for the United Kingdom and Ireland it was only sold as the Chrysler 300C. It has since been discontinued in 2015. The Lancia Voyager was a large MPV unveiled in 2011, which was based on the Chrysler Town & Country. It was marketed in various European markets, but for the United Kingdom and Ireland it was only sold as the Chrysler Grand Voyager. It has since been discontinued in 2015. Lancia has shown several concept cars to the public including the Flaminia Loratmo (1958), Stratos Zero (1970), the Megagamma by Italdesign Giugiaro and Sibilo by Bertone in 1978, Hit (1988) by Pininfarina, the Bertone designed Kayak (1995), the Dialogos (1998) and Nea in 2000.[12] More recently the company has shown the Granturismo Stilnovo and Fulvia.[13] concepts in 2003. In the end of 1960, Lancia made their first landaulet-limousine for the President of Italy, called the Lancia Flaminia 335 Presidenziale . In 1989, Lancia made a limousine version of the Thema. 24 examples for Fiat-Group executives. In 1999, Lancia made a one-off limousine version of the Kappa and at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show, Stola showed a limousine version of the Thesis. In January 2014, in an interview with La Repubblica, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne foreshadowed that Lancia would become an Italy\u2013only brand, and focus only on the Ypsilon supermini range.[1] While some models had been imported on a small scale during the 1950s to the 1960s, Lancias were officially sold in the United States from 1975. Sales were comparatively slow, and the range was withdrawn at the same time as Fiat in 1982. In 2009, following Fiat's acquisition of a stake in United States-based Chrysler and part of Chrysler's restructuring plans, it was stated that Fiat plans for the Chrysler brand and Lancia to co\u2013develop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia's CEO, took over as CEO of the Chrysler division in October 2009. Fiat has also announced that, depending on the market, some Chrysler cars would be sold as Lancias and vice versa. Francois' plans to re establish the Chrysler brand as an upscale brand were somewhat muddied by the discontinuance of the Plymouth brand.[14] At the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, a Chrysler badged Lancia Delta was on display,[15] but this did not result in sales in the United States, with proposals to instead modify an Alfa Romeo for sale by 2013.[16] Lancia's reputation was significantly undermined in 1980, when defective Lancia Beta models, suffering from significant suspension sub-frame corrosion problems, were purchased back from owners by the company in a highly publicised campaign. These cars were subsequently crushed.[17] The brand never recovered from the damage inflicted during the Beta recall and, combined with a range of related factors (including poor residual values, which made their range uncompetitive), decided to withdraw from the right hand drive market in February 1994.[18] The last model be sold in the United Kingdom was the Delta, boosted by its rallying reputation, withdrawn from sale in 1995. After 1995, there were continuous rumours suggesting Lancia's return to the United Kingdom. In November 2005, What Car? reported rumours over the alleged return, to rival \"affordable\" premium makes, such as Saab and Volvo.[19] In September 2006, What Car? reported that Lancia were officially returning to the United Kingdom.[20] The relaunch date was set for August 2008. In April 2008, Car reported that Lancia had postponed the relaunch.[21] In June 2009, Autocar reported that the relaunch of Lancia was now \u201cvery unlikely\u201d.[22] These were credible since Lancia models, by that time, shared common parts with Fiat and Alfa Romeo models that were imported, sold and maintained by an existing dealership network. The cost to reestablish the brand were therefore minimal. In December 2008, however, Fiat cancelled relaunch plans, due to financial concerns coinciding with the global financial crisis, and the recession.[23] In 2011, Lancia Ypsilon and Delta models were eventually re introduced to the United Kingdom, but were re branded as Chrysler. In January 2014, the Delta model was dropped from this line up. In March 2015, Fiat Group announced that the Chrysler brand would be discontinued in the United Kingdom in 2017, citing a desire to focus largely on the Jeep brand instead.[24] A small number of Lancia models were previously sold in Japan, such as Fulvia, Stratos and Delta. More recently, some models have been sold under the Chrysler brand, such as the Ypsilon. After Vincenzo Lancia's son Gianni became director of the firm, it started to take part more frequently in motorsport, eventually deciding to build a Grand Prix car. Vittorio Jano was the new designer for Lancia and his Lancia D50 was entered into the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix, where Alberto Ascari took the pole position and drove the fastest lap. In the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix Ascari crashed into the harbour after missing a chicane. One week later Ascari was killed in an accident driving a Ferrari sports car at Monza. With Ascari's death and Lancia's financial problems the company withdrew from Grand Prix racing.[25] Altogether Lancia took two victories and ten podiums in Formula One.[26] Remnants of the Lancia team were transferred to Scuderia Ferrari,[27] where Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1956 championship with a Lancia-Ferrari car. Lancia has been very successful in motorsport over the years, and mostly in the arena of rallying. Prior to the forming of the World Rally Championship, Lancia took the final International Championship for Manufacturers title with the Fulvia in 1972. In the WRC, they remain the most statistically successful marque (despite having withdrawn at the end of the 1993 season), winning constructors' titles with the Stratos (1974, 1975 and 1976), the 037 (1983) and the Delta (six consecutive wins from 1987 to 1992). The Delta is also the most successful individual model designation ever to compete in rallying. All this gave Lancia a total of 11 Championships over the years. Juha Kankkunen and Miki Biasion both won two drivers' titles with the Delta. Among other drivers to take several World Rally Championship wins with Lancia were Markku Al\u00e9n, Didier Auriol, Sandro Munari, Bernard Darniche, Walter R\u00f6hrl, Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd and Henri Toivonen. The history of the brand in rallying is also tainted with tragedy, with deaths of Italian driver Attilio Bettega at the 1985 Tour de Corse in a Lancia 037 and then Finnish championship favourite Toivonen in a Lancia Delta S4 at the same rally exactly a year later. These deaths would eventually lead to the end of Group B rallying.  In 1951 Mille Miglia, Lancia Aurelia B20 GT came second overall. The car was driven by Thornley Kelham.[28].  In 1953, Umberto Maglioli won the Targa Florio at the wheel of the Lancia D20. The same year Lancia introduced the D24 sports racer, which was an evolution of D23 model, but rebodied as a spider by Pinin Farina. Its most significant victories were: the 1953 Carrera Panamericana, the 1954 Mille Miglia and the 1954 Targa Florio. During Lancia's dominance of rallying, the company also expanded into sports cars in the late 1970s until the mid-1980s. Originally running the Stratos HF in Group 4, as well as a brief interlude with a rare Group 5 version, the car was replaced with the successful Beta Montecarlo Turbo winning the FIA's 1980 World Championship for Makes and 1981 World Endurance Championship for Makes and the 1980 Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft. In 1982 the team moved up to Group 6 with the LC1 Spyder, followed by the Group C LC2 coup\u00e9 which featured a Ferrari powerplant in 1983. The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting Porsche 956 in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime, however its results were hampered by poor reliability and fuel economy and it only managed to win three European and World Endurance Championship races. The team's inability to compete against the dominant Porsche 956 and 962 sports cars led it to drop out of sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s. Lancia produced a wide range of vans, trucks, buses and military vehicles from the beginning, forming Lancia Veicoli Industriali in 1912. Lancia slowly withdrew from the commercial sectors during the late 1960s and production of commercial vehicles ended in the early 1970s, shortly after Fiat's takeover of the company, with some models transferred to Iveco. The company has previously made a number of industrial engines.[citation needed] In 2009, the British motoring television show Top Gear suggested that Lancia had more 'great' models than any other car company.[29] The presenters went on to test the Gamma Coup\u00e9, Fulvia Coup\u00e9, Aprilia, Montecarlo, Beta Coup\u00e9, HPE, Stratos, 037, Delta Integrale Evo II and Thema 8.32. They also stated during their review that Lancia made the best looking cars, even though they are unreliable.[citation needed] Lancia sponsored the Venice Film Festival for five years, ending in 2012, with the Lancia Thema used to transport stars to the festival.[30] Lancia was sponsor of ninth and eleventh World Summit of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates.

Founded in Turin in 1895 by Luigi Lavazza, it was initially run from a small grocery store at Via San Tommaso 10. The business of Lavazza S.p.A. is currently administered by the third and fourth generations of the Lavazza family. Lavazza imports coffee from around the world, including Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Uganda, Indonesia, United States and Mexico.  Sustainable production concerns have led the company to develop the \u00a1Tierra! project, a sustainable agriculture program in Honduras, Colombia and Peru, that seeks to improve the quality of coffee as well as the environmental and working conditions of those communities.[2] Branded as \"Italy's Favourite Coffee,\" the company claims that 16 million out of the 20 million coffee purchasing families in Italy choose Lavazza.[3] Among its offerings today are products such as: Qualit\u00e0 Oro, Qualit\u00e0 Rosso, Club, Caff\u00e8 Espresso, Il Perfetto Espresso, Caff\u00e8 Crema, Gran Aroma Bar, Super Crema, Crema e Gusto, Crema e Aroma, Top Class, Grand'Espresso, Dek (decaffeinated), and coffee capsules A Modo Mio, \"Espresso Point\" and Lavazza Blue. The company operates a number of retail coffee shops (\"Il Caff\u00e8 di Roma\" and \"Espression\"). The shops offer traditional coffee drinks as well as whole bean and ground coffee for home use. Lavazza, established in Turin, Italy, in 1895, has been owned by the family of the same name for four generations. The world's seventh ranking coffee roaster, today Lavazza is the retail market leader in Italy with a market share by value of over 47% (source Nielsen), 2,700 employees and sales of 1,340 million euros (2013). The company has six production sites, four in Italy and two abroad, and operates through associated companies and distributors in more than 90 countries. Lavazza exports 46% of its production today. Lavazza credits itself with inventing the concept of blending, \"the art of combining different types of coffee from different geographical areas\", in its early years and claims this as a distinctive feature of all its products. The company also has 25 years experience in the production and sale of portioned coffee systems. Today, through ongoing partnerships with an international network of universities and scientific research centers, Lavazza operates four platforms in this segment. In 1979 the company established the \"Luigi Lavazza Centre for coffee research\" which is \"devoted to the study of espresso\" and has evolved into the Lavazza Training Centre, a network of over 50 coffee schools worldwide, where 30 thousand people receive training each year. Among the activities promoted by the Lavazza Foundation, established in 2002, is the Tierra project which, in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance, performs research into achieving the \"finest end product quality\", with a focus on the living conditions of people in coffee producing countries.[4] Lavazza is the official coffee in the Italian Pavilion at the Expo 2015 in Milan. Lavazza acquired the Carte Noire and Merrild brands from Jacobs Douwe Egberts in February 2016. Lavazza purchased an 80% stake in Canadian-based Kicking Horse Coffee in May 2017.[5] \"Luigi Lavazza S.p.A.\" is present in over 90 countries with more than 20 offices and manufacturing plants in Italy and in the rest of the world. In Turin, in Via Bologna, was recently inaugurated \"Nuvola\",[6] the new Lavazza Headquarter. The \"Nuvola\" project is the work of Cino Zucchi Architetti and is at the heart of the recent qualification of the Aurora district. In addition to Turin, Luigi Lavazza S.p.A. has 12 other European offices and is also present in the United States,[7] in Australia,[8] South America, India (with two locations) and Morocco. Currently the Lavazza Group includes 21 companies and international offices, including the Turinese Headquarter \"Nuvola\" and San Tommaso 10, the same old store in Via San Tommaso owned by Luigi Lavazza in the late 1800. The Lavazza Group includes also 4 main manufacturing plants: in Turin there is the first historical manufacturing plant; in Italy Lavazza plants are also present in Gattinara, where Lavazza A Modo Mio, Lavazza Espresso Point and Lavazza Blue capsules are produced, and in Pozzilli, where the decaffeinated coffee is made for the worldwide distribution. Other manufacturing plants are located in France, India and Brazil.The Lavazza Group includes also 4 main manufacturing plants. The first historical plant is in Turin; in 2016 Luigi Lavazza SpA had acquired the French manufacturing plant in Lav\u00e9rune. Since 1991, Lavazza has produced the \"Lavazza Calendar\", featuring fashion photography from some of the world's leading photographers.  The calendar is not available for purchase.[13]  Contributors have included Annie Leibovitz in 2009, David LaChapelle in 2002, Helmut Newton in 1993 and 1994, Ellen Von Unwerth in 1995, Eugenio Recuenco in 2007, Erwin Olaf in 2005, and Platon in 2018.[14][15][16] The calendar has become a showpiece of conceptual fashion photography.[17] ",

            "text": "Laverda (Moto Laverda S.A.S. \u2013 Dottore Francesco Laverda e fratelli) was an Italian manufacturer of high performance motorcycles. The motorcycles in their day gained a reputation for being robust and innovative. The Laverda brand was absorbed by Piaggio when, in 2004, Piaggio absorbed Aprilia.  Piaggio has elected to quietly close all activities related to the Laverda brand and has publicly stated that they would be willing to sell the rights to the brand if an investor should appear. As of 2015, Laverda.com no longer redirects to Aprilia's website. Currently, laverda.com shows the history of company between 1873 and 2004. The roots of the Laverda Motorcycle company go back to 1873, when Pietro Laverda (1845-1930) decided to start an agricultural engines enterprise \u2013 Laverda S.p.A. \u2013 in the small rural village of Breganze in Vicenza province (North-East of Italy). Almost exactly three quarters of a century later, with a spirit of enterprise and feeling the need to improve the situation of an economically underdeveloped region which had suffered badly from two world wars, in October 1949, Pietro's grandson Francesco founded Moto Laverda S.A.S. \u2013 Dottore Francesco Laverda e fratelli. Assisted by Luciano Zen, and after hours of running the normal agricultural business, Francesco had started in 1947 to design a small motorcycle. Word has it, that some engine parts were cast in Francesco's kitchen, confirming that at least initially, the project was not regarded as a serious business proposition. What most likely started as an evening pastime garage project of two technical enthusiasts was to become one of the most successful motorcycles in history. A simple four stroke 75 cc bike with girder forks and a fully enclosed drive chain. However, the little bike showed promise and so on October 13, 1949, the statutes of Moto Laverda were officially submitted to the Chamber of Commerce of Vicenza. Over the next several years, Laverda became well known for building small capacity machines of high quality, durability and relative innovation for the time.  To prove this, right from the beginning they modified their bikes in order to race them in distance and endurance events like the Milan-Taranto, the Giro d'Italia and the Cavalcata delle Dolomiti. In 1951 upon their first entry in the Milan-Taranto, the 75 cc Laverdas finished 4th, 5th, 6th and 10th in their class, racing against renowned marques like Ducati, Moto Guzzi, Alpino, Verga, Cimatti, Navarra, Ardito, Capriolo and Ceccato. Inspired by these results, and after once again improving their bikes, Laverda entered 20 bikes the following year in the 15th running of the Milan-Taranto in 1952. In this race which covered a distance of 1410\u00a0km they took the first five places. The winner was Nino Castellani, L. Marchi came second and F. Diolio came third. In total they had 16 bikes amongst the first 20 of the classification. Laverda motorcycles thus became a firm favorite among racing clubmen due to their record for reliable performance. Over the next two decades, Laverda would go on to produce new models of ever increasing capacity and capability, in different sectors of the market.  Off-road, trial and motocross machines were developed in conjunction with other manufacturers like Z\u00fcndapp, BMW and Husqvarna, and were successfully raced.  But the real development came in street models, which began to earn a good reputation as classy, low maintenance and quiet motorcycles.  From that first 75 cc single, they eventually went on to produce different bikes ranging from scooters, the Laverdino commuter and eventually to the 200 cc twin. By the late 1960s, Francesco and brothers began sketching out a new breed of large motorcycles that would be built around an all new 650 cc parallel twin engine.  The brand was now sufficiently strong and well known, and Francesco's son Massimo had just returned from the USA where it was clear that sales were dominated by large capacity British and American hardware suited for long distance traveling.[1]  Above all this, was a desire to produce a prestigious and powerful machine that could conceivably take on the best and finest from Moto-Guzzi, BMW and the rapidly emerging Japanese. In November 1966 Laverda exhibited the result of its thinking with the 650 prototype at Earls Court in London. While not an extreme sport bike in any sense, it exhibited all the virtues that Laverda had become synonymous with.  At the same time its appearance disrupted the concept of a big bore parallel twin being British built.  After this first appearance, Luciano Zen and Massimo Laverda retreated until April 1968, working hard in order to prepare the bike for production.  By now they had developed a 750 cc version too.  They were confident enough to enter four examples in the prestigious Giro d'Italia.  Two 650 and two 750 machines provided Laverda with victory for the 650 in her class, with three bikes finishing in the first 6 and all in the top 10! Two weeks after this victory the first 650 cc production models left the factory. The bikes carried the finest components available at the time, from British Smiths instruments, Pankl con-rods, Ceriani suspension, Mondial pistons, to Bosch electrical parts and (revolutionary at the time!) Japanese Nippon-Denso starter, thus eliminating the one problem plaguing nearly all contemporary British and Italian motorcycles at the time: their electrical unreliability.  The 650 cc offered superior comfort and stability with its handling at least equivalent to the competition.  Of course, it also carried a high price. It is difficult to quantify production quantities since frame numbering was shared with the 750 launched in May 1968 - as few as 52 or up to 200 Laverda 650 cc were produced. The true birth of Laverda as a serious big bike brand occurred with the introduction of 750 cc; its appearance halted sales of the recently introduced 650. Many of the first bikes were produced for the American market under the brand \"American Eagle\", which were imported to the US from 1968 until 1969 by Jack McCormack. The 750 was identical to the 650 except for the lower compression and carburettor rejetting. In 1969 the \"750 S\" and the \"750 GT\" were born, both equipped with an engine which would truly start the Laverda fame. Both engine and frame were reworked: power was increased to 60\u00a0bhp (45\u00a0kW) for the S. 3 bikes were entered by the factory at the 1969 Dutch 24-hour endurance race in Oss, the 750S was clearly the fastest bike until piston failure left just one machine to finish fourth. Just like the agricultural machinery made by Laverda S.p.A., the other family business, Laverdas were built to be indestructible.  The parallel twin cylinder engine featured no less than five main bearings (four crankcase bearings and a needle-roller outrigger bearing in the primary chaincase cover), a duplex cam chain, and a starter motor easily twice as powerful as needed.  Of course, this made the engine and subsequently the entire bike heavier than other bikes of the same vintage, such as the Ducati 750. The SF evolved to include disc brakes and cast alloy wheels. Developed from the 750S road bike was the 750 SFC (super freni competizione), a half-faired racer that was developed to win endurance events like the Oss 24 hours, Barcelona 24 hours and the Bol D'Or at Le Mans.  This it did, often placed first, second and third in the same race, and dominating the international endurance race circuit in 1971.[2]  Distinguished by its characteristic orange paint which would become the company's race department colour, its smooth aerodynamic fairing and upswept exhaust, the SFC was Laverda's flagship product and best advertisement, flaunting pedigree and the message of durability, quality, and exclusivity.  The SFC \"Series 15,000\" was featured in the Guggenheim Museum in New York's 1999 exhibit The Art of the Motorcycle as one of the most iconic bikes of the 1970s. By the late 1960s, Laverda was facing increasing competition from the Japanese. While launching their new 750\u00a0cc (46\u00a0cu\u00a0in) model range in 1968, the company turned its attention to a new three-cylinder powerplant, which was first shown as a prototype at the Milan and Geneva shows in 1969. The 1,000\u00a0cc (61\u00a0cu\u00a0in) prototype was essentially a 750 twin with an additional cylinder.[3] After extensive testing, modifications, and mechanical engineering, the company finally unveiled the new liter-class, three-cylinder bike in competition at the Zeltweg race in Austria. The bike that went into production shortly later in 1972 was recognisable as a motorcycle of the modern era, but it was still configured in a conservative layout, sharing some of the features of the earlier SF/SFC models, such as the high-quality alloy castings and distinctive styling. The 981\u00a0cc triple provided more power than the outgoing twins, with not much more weight. The 1973-1981 Laverda 1000 3C Triple model that made 85\u00a0hp (63\u00a0kW) @ 7,250rpm and reaching speeds of more than 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h).[4]  The new Laverda Jota based on the 3C made a big impression in 1976 producing 90\u00a0hp (67\u00a0kW) and reaching speeds of 146\u00a0mph (235\u00a0km/h), thanks to the factory racing parts fitted into the road engine directly at the factory, it was the fastest production motorcycle to date.[5] British importer Roger Slater worked with the factory to develop a high-performance version of the bike, the Jota.[6]  Laverda three-cylinder engines up to 1982  featured a 180-degree crankshaft arrangement, in which the center piston is at the top of its stroke when the  two outer pistons are at the bottom. This purposefully out-of-phase design gave the 1,000\u00a0cc Laverdas a distinctive character.  The engine evolved into a smoother, rubber mounted 120\u00a0degree configuration in 1982. The three cylinder 1978-1979 Laverda 1200 TS Mirage was one of the largest displacements ever to be fitted on a machine from Laverda. The1,115\u00a0cc (68.0\u00a0cu\u00a0in) produced 73\u00a0hp (54\u00a0kW) and 40\u00a0lb\u22c5ft (54\u00a0N\u22c5m) and a weight of 545\u00a0lb (247\u00a0kg).[7] In 1977, Laverda unveiled a V6 at the Milan Show, and went on to enter it in the 24-hour Bol d'Or race held at the Paul Ricard circuit in France. While notching an impressive straight-away speed of 175.46\u00a0mph (282.38\u00a0km/h) during a practice run, its performance in the race was hindered by a bulky build and it did not finish the race. Laverda planned on re-entering the V6 in the 1979 race but rule changes limited Endurance racers to four cylinders and the V6 project was officially ended.[8] Laverda launched a smaller 500\u00a0cc twin cylinder eight-valve entry-level machine named the Alpina in 1977 (quickly renamed Alpino due to trademark infringement and Zeta in the USA). It came with a six-speed gearbox and balance shaft. A 350\u00a0cc version of the Alpino was also available from November 1977 \u2013 primarily designed for the home Italian market where a high tax was payable for machines over 350\u00a0cc.  This was followed by the improved Alpino S and Formula 500 racer in 1978, to support a single model race series.  Its import into the UK led Roger Slater to develop the Montjuic in 1979 which was a road legal F500 with lights, sidestand & instruments.[6] It evolved into the mk2 in 1981. EEC noise restrictions saw its demise by 1983.  Tellingly, Massimo Laverda said that each Alpino sold lost the factory money.[citation needed] Then somewhere in the mid eighties an enduro frame was built with 500\u00a0cc engine, which was followed by the Atlas series with 570\u00a0cc engine and improved oil cooling. By the 1980s, the European motorcycle industry as a whole was reeling from Japanese competition, causing many companies like NVT (the amalgamated surviving British companies Norton, Triumph, and BSA), Moto-Guzzi, and many others to struggle or disappear completely.  Laverda attempted to update their product line by introducing the RGS sports tourer in 1983,  with features such unbreakable Bayflex plastic mouldings; fuel filler in the fairing; integrated but removable luggage (Executive version), and adjustable footpeg position.  In 1985, came the SFC 1000 sports model \u2013 a badge engineered attempt based on the RGS to reprise the hallowed SFC name.[9] Underneath the new skin were engines and technologies that were ten years out of date and overpriced when compared to the lighter, faster, cheaper and more advanced Japanese bikes. As an example, in 1983 the Montjuic mk2 cost the same as the four-cylinder, 100\u00a0bhp (75\u00a0kW) Kawasaki Z1000J. On the race tracks too, the Japanese bikes dominated. Flirtations with a highly complex aluminum framed, 350\u00a0cc three-cylinder two-stroke and the  unsuccessful V6 endurance racer consumed resources that the small factory could not afford.  Combined with this, the motorcycle industry in general was in trouble as sales dropped.  In these conditions, the Laverda family bowed out by 1985. Initiatives to save Laverda, included a Japanese investment company who wanted to sell apparel and other merchandise under the name; to a local government initiative which tried to run the factory as a co-operative; but each of these failed. In 1993, millionaire Francesco Tognon bought everything, thus saving the company and setting up what looked like the first serious attempt in a decade to relaunch the brand.  Over the next five years, they launched a small selection of new sports models based on a thorough redo of the  DOHC 650\u00a0cc parallel-twin derived from the old Alpino, upped to 668\u00a0cc and clothed in contemporary superbike livery.  These bikes were outfitted with Weber-Marelli electronic fuel injection, Brembo Gold Line brakes, fully adjustable Paioli suspension (White Power on some models), hollow spoke Marchesini wheels and a modern beam or trellis frame. Within a year and a half, a larger, water cooled 750 appeared with a new engine in an aluminum beam chassis developed by frame specialist Nico Bakker. At successive international motorcycle shows, Laverda displayed mockups of new models they were planning to build, including an all new, 900\u00a0cc liquid-cooled three-cylinder engine; The 750 roadster variants Ghost and Strike; the Lynx, a small, naked roadster with a Suzuki 650\u00a0cc V-twin engine; and finally the 800TTS trail/enduro, which aimed to take on the likes of the Cagiva Gran Canyon and Honda Transalp.  The venture failed after five years. Along with historical rival Moto-Guzzi, the Laverda motorcycle brand was purchased by Aprilia S.p.a (another Italian motorcycle manufacturer based in the same region) in 2000, restructured and incorporated into the Aprilia Group.  Several projects that had been in development and the existing two motorcycles in production, were cancelled.  Aprilia founded a new Laverda division business unit which shortly after began importing low cost Asian scooters and quads and selling them under the Laverda brand name. In 2003, Laverda presented a new SFC prototype, based on a heavily revised Aprilia RSV1000 at the Milan EICMA motorcycle show.  While stunning in many aspects, in particular the attention to component and mechanical detailing, it did not generate enough positive interest to merit further development. In 2004, the Aprilia Group was acquired by Piaggio, the giant scooter manufacturer of Vespa fame.  Piaggio elected to close all activities related to the Laverda brand, and has publicly stated that they would be willing to sell the rights to the brand if an investor should appear.  Today, the brand is no longer in use.  Media related to Moto Laverda at Wikimedia Commons ",

            "text": "Leonardo S.p.A., formerly Leonardo-Finmeccanica and Finmeccanica, is an Italian multinational company specialising in aerospace, defence and security. Headquartered in Rome, the company has 180 sites worldwide.[3] It is the ninth largest defence contractor in the world based on 2016 revenues.[4] The company is partially owned by the Italian government through the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which holds 30.2% of the company's shares and is its largest shareholder. On 1 January 2016, Leonardo-Finmeccanica became a single industrial company by integrating the activities of its subsidiaries AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, DRS Technologies, Selex ES, Oto Melara and WASS. The company is organised into five divisions (Helicopters, Aircraft, Aerostructures, Electronics, Cybersecurity) and is also the parent company and corporate centre for the subsidiaries and joint ventures, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space, MBDA and ATR. Leonardo is listed on the Borsa Italiana and is a constituent of the FTSE MIB and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. As of April 2016[update], the company was known by the transitional name of Leonardo-Finmeccanica as part of the restructuring process of the company carried out by CEO Mauro Moretti from the beginning of his mandate in 2014. The company changed its name to Leonardo S.p.A. on 1 January 2017, after the Italian inventor Leonardo da Vinci.[5][6] The company was established in 1948 as the mechanical engineering subholding of the state-owned IRI. Finmeccanica has held for years some historic Italian enterprises, as Alfa Romeo (automobiles), Aeritalia (aerospace) and Ansaldo (engineering). From the 1960s to the 1980s Italy's defence and aerospace industry was split into state-holding entities: EFIM owned the helicopters manufacturer Agusta, the defence company Oto Melara and the electronic enterprise Officine Galileo, whereas STET (another IRI subsidiary) held Selenia, Elsag and SGS Thomson, all electronic enterprises with specializations in security and defense. In 1989 an internal IRI reorganization process brought STET electronic enterprises to Finmeccanica, and the Aeritalia-Selenia merger constituted its aerospace subsidiary Alenia. In 1992 EFIM was wound up because of its troubled financial situation; and Agusta, Oto Melara, Officine Galileo and Breda passed to Finmeccanica, which became one of the main Italian industrial groups. Finmeccanica, which was previously fully state owned by IRI, became partly privatized in 1993, when it was listed in the Milan Borsa Italiana stock exchange. In 1992 Finmeccanica's Agusta became a 32% partner in NHIndustries, the prime contractor for the NH90 helicopter, along with Eurocopter (62.5%) and Fokker (5.5%). In July 2000 Finmeccanica and the British GKN agreed to merge their respective helicopter subsidiaries (Agusta and GKN-Westland Helicopters) to form AgustaWestland. In December 2001 the missile business of Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS), a joint Finmeccanica/BAE Systems company, was merged with other European missile manufacturers to form MBDA which thus became the world's second largest missile manufacturer.[7] In July 2003 Finmeccanica and BAE Systems announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as Eurosystems. These companies would have pooled the avionics, C4ISTAR and communications businesses of the two companies.[8] In March 2007 BAE Systems sold its 25% share to Finmeccanica for \u20ac400\u00a0million.[9] In January 2013 the company merged with Finmeccanica's other defence electronics companies, SELEX Elsag and SELEX Sistemi Integrati, to become Selex ES. In May 2008 Finmeccanica announced its intention to purchase the U.S. defense contractor DRS Technologies for nearly $5.2 billion. On 22 October 2008 the sale of DRS Technologies was finalized.[10] During 2011\u20132013, Finmeccanica emails were published by WikiLeaks and Finmeccanica was subject to judicial inquiries on several fronts and management changes. According to Finmeccanica emails published in the Syria Files release by WikiLeaks on 5 July 2012,[11] Finmeccanica increased its sale of mobile communications equipment to Syrian authorities during 2011, delivering 500 of these to the Damascus suburb Muadamia in May 2011,[12][13] after the Syrian uprising had started, and sending engineers to Damascus in February 2012 to provide training in using the communications equipment in helicopter terminals,[14] while the uprising continued.[15] Finmeccanica stated that the equipment sales were legal, they occurred \"before the outbreak of conflict inside Syria\", and the equipment \"was designed for use by emergency responders\" for civilian use only.[15] On 12 February 2013, the chief executive, Giuseppe Orsi, was arrested on corruption charges. Prosecutors alleged that he paid bribes to ensure the sale of 12 helicopters to the Indian government, when he was head of the group's AgustaWestland unit.[16][17] In July 2013, the Letta government appointed former police chief Giovanni De Gennaro as Chairman of Finmeccanica. In December 2013 Finmeccanica sold 39.55% of its share capital in Ansaldo Energia to Fondo Strategico Italiano. The remaining 15% of Finmeccanica's share will be sold by December 31, 2017. In the first half of 2014, Finmeccanica's new Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Mauro Moretti started a significant process of change for the Group, both in terms of strategic choices and organizational structure. The goal was to create a more cohesive and efficient group in which all processes (research, marketing and sales, engineering, procurement, strategies and governance) are centralized and integrated and can interact each other.[18] This encompasses the 100% owned companies of the core aerospace and defence business (AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, Oto Melara, Selex ES and WASS) being transformed into seven new Finmeccanica divisions. The current holding company will then become an operating company based on seven major business areas, maintaining its parent company and corporate centre function for the Group companies excluded from the model (DRS Technologies, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space, MBDA and ATR). At the end of 2014, Finmeccanica transferred its stake in BredaMenarinibus to the newco Industria Italiana Autobus (20% Finmeccanica and 80% King Long), thereby taking a further step in the Group's portfolio rationalization process. In 2015 Hitachi signed a binding agreement with Finmeccanica for Hitachi's acquisition of the AnsaldoBreda business, excluding some revamping activities and residual contracts, and of the entire Finmeccanica stake in the share capital of Ansaldo STS, approximately 40% of the total capital. FATA, another subsidiary of the Finmeccanica Group since 2004 that was not part of the core business, was sold in 2015 to the Gruppo Danieli, dealing in the production of steel plants. On 1 January 2016, Finmeccanica become a single integrated industrial entity that have absorbed the activities of AgustaWestland, Alenia Aermacchi, Selex ES, OTO Melara and WASS. A company rebranding operation led by Mauro Moretti began in March 2016, with a proposal to change the company name. From 1 January 2017 Finmeccanica officially became Leonardo, a name inspired by the Italian savant Leonardo da Vinci.[6][19][20]  On 18 March 2017 the Italian Treasury proposed that the veteran banker Alessandro Profumo replace Mauro Moretti as CEO of Leonardo,[21] and on 16 May the Board appointed Alessandro Profumo to the role.[22] On 30 January 2018, Leonardo presented the 2018-2022 Industrial Plan[23] with the aim of taking the necessary actions to return to sustainable growth in the five-year period. The outlook in the reference markets is positive, particularly in international export markets, allowing Leonardo to concentrate on existing opportunities for its core businesses. After having taken several steps towards building the \"One Company\" operating model, Leonardo now considers an acceleration necessary to ensure the sustainability of the business in the medium-long term, strengthening the business structure and enhancing the commercial approach. The 2018-2022 Industrial Plan is therefore based on a transformation process that will be implemented across the areas of operating model optimisation, a more effective customer approach, targeted investments to support growth, a focus on cost control and product portfolio \"reshaping\". Aeronautics Leonardo designs, develops, produces, maintains and upgrades commercial, military and military training aircraft, as well as producing aerostructures. The company is part of a network of joint ventures and product partnerships, including such programmes as Eurofighter (with BAE Systems and Airbus Group) to build the supersonic multi-role Typhoon and ATR (with Airbus Group) to build the family of turboprop regional aircraft of the same name. Helicopters Leonardo is active in the helicopter market, managing: development to production, pilot training and after sales support. Leonardo produces a range of helicopters for the commercial and defence markets, including all the main weight categories, from 1.8-tonne single-engined to 16-tonne three-engined helicopters. Electronics, Defence & Security Systems Leonardo develops and integrates systems for the air and sea traffic management and the control and protection of land and sea borders; it also develops secure communications networks and solutions[buzzword] for the management of infrastructure and systems. The services include the design and management of IT infrastructure and data processing for intelligence and cyber security. Leonardo is active in the design, development and production of naval artillery, armoured vehicles and underwater systems. In the Electronics, Defence and Security Systems sector, Leonardo operates through its US subsidiary DRS Technologies and the joint venture MBDA (37.5% BAE Systems, 37.5% Airbus Group and 25% Leonardo) that produces missiles and missile systems. Space In the space sector, Leonardo is active mainly through joint ventures Telespazio (Leonardo 67% - Thales 33%) and Thales Alenia Space (Leonardo 33% - Thales 67%). Telespazio offers a wide range of skills and services from design and development of space systems, launch services management and in-orbit satellites to Earth observation services, integrated communications and satellite navigation and localisation. Thales Alenia Space is engaged in the design, integration, testing and implementation of space systems, for navigation, telecommunications, meteorology, environmental control, defence, scientific missions and Earth observation. Leonardo is present worldwide in about 20 countries (42% in Italy and 58% abroad). Commercially,  there are about 150 countries in the world that use products, systems and services supplied by Leonardo. Its production activities and its main industrial and commercial bases are located in Italy, the United Kingdom, Poland and the United States. Moreover, Leonardo has gained a significant presence in France and Germany, and is a partner for various international industrial collaborations.[24][25] The company is an ITER supplier. As of 13 March 2016 Leonardo-Finmeccanica's largest shareholder was the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finances with 30.20%. Other declared shareholdings at this date were Norges Bank (2.03%), the Libyan Investment Authority (2.01%) [26] and the Vanguard Group (1.30%). Source:[31]  ",

It was founded in 1925 as a family company by Alfons Loacker. Loacker has production facilities in Bolzano, Ritten and Heinfels (Austria). It is known for its confections, particularly for its Quadratini, thin cubes composed of wafers layered with sheets of creme. Its products are sold around the globe. Loacker distributes Twinings products in Italy.[3] Loacker SpA was founded in 1925 by Alfons Loacker. It began as a small cafe and bakery.[4] Loacker specialised in crafting fine European baked goods such as tortes and cakes, but then focused on baked goods that would retain their freshness over longer periods of time. The decision was actually a by-product of Loacker\u2019s obsession with football as he did not want to work at night, so he started specialising in wafers.[citation needed] As the decades passed, and the company quickly transformed itself into a regional and then an international specialty, new generations of the Loacker family took over the business. Today, Loacker is operated by the founder's grandsons. By 1974, the company had grown too large for its facilities in Bolzano and had moved to its headquarters in Auna di Sotto. It eventually expanded its Bolzano facilities in 1990. By 1999, it was building a production site in eastern Tyrol, at a facility specialising in wafers and cr\u00e8me, as well as the company\u2019s chocolate specialities. Today, Loacker employs 662 people, 367 at its main site. Altogether, its activities brought in revenues of 329,3 million EUR in 2016.[5]  ",

Originally from Trivero (a district in north Italy famous for textile production), the Loro Piana family started as merchants of wool fabrics at the beginning of the 19th century. In the second half of the 19th century, the family moved its activity to Valsesia and founded the Lanificio Fratelli Lora e Compagnia, followed by Lanificio di Quarona di Zignone & C. at the beginning of the 20th century. Franco Loro Piana, Pier Luigi\u2019s father, started exporting fine fabrics in the 1940s and Pier Luigi and his older brother, Sergio, joined in the 1970s. On 8 July 2013, LVMH  purchased 80% of Loro Piana for \u20ac2\u00a0billion, the rest of shareholding remaining in Loro Piana family's hands.[1] Put and call options on the family's 20% stake expired in 2016. On 19 December 2013, Sergio Loro Piana died.[2] In 2017 the Loro Piana family reduced their 20% ownership holdings to 15%.[3] Specifically, Pier Luigi Loro Piana cut his holdings down to 5 percent, While the family of Sergio Loro Piana still own their original 10 percent.[4] The company has stores  in Europe, North America, and Asia, totalling 132 stores worldwide.[5] In 2012, turnover reached \u20ac700\u00a0million and net income represented 20% of sales.[1] In December 2013, LVMH announced that Antoine Arnault would become chairperson of Loro Piana.[6] In 2016, revenue was estimated at \u20ac800\u00a0million. The company produces about 5\u00a0million meters of fabric each year, and supplying textiles to other brands accounts for about a quarter of its revenue. Loro Piana owns the Italian mill Solbiati.[7] In 1985, the company began sponsoring Italian and international horsemen and partnered with the Italian Equestrian Sports Federation (FISE).[8] Loro Piana sponsored the Around the Island Race 2006 in Hong Kong. Since 2008, Loro Piana has sponsored two annual super yacht sailing regattas, organised by Boat International Media and the Yacht Club Costa Smerelda. Since 2000, Loro Piana has sponsored an annual prize for the best bale of wool, which produces  enough fabric for 50 men's suits. Generally, it is won by an Australian or New Zealand woolgrower.[9] In 2008, Loro Piana paid a record 48,000 cents per kilo for a bale of superfine  merino wool averaging 12.5 micron  produced by Peter and Greg Munsie and Phil and Judy Fittler of Uralla, New South Wales.[10] ",

Lotto was established in 1939 by the Caberlotto family (who were the owners of the football team F.C. Treviso) in Montebelluna, northern Italy, the world centre of footwear manufacturing. In June 1973, Lotto made its debut as a sports footwear manufacturer. Tennis shoes signaled the beginning of production, followed by models for basketball, volleyball, athletics and football. Sports clothing was the company's next venture. In the first ten years, Lotto focused on the Italian market. During its first decade, corporate strategy concentrated on making tennis footwear and clothing, and early on sponsored big names from the professional tennis circuit (Martina Navratilova, Boris Becker, Thomas Muster, Andrea Gaudenzi). In the 1980s, Lotto moved on to broaden its business base by competing among the then-small group of manufacturers of football boots and clothing. Lotto began to create its first football boot models and signed major collaboration agreements with internationally renowned players and teams. Tennis players John Newcombe, Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez and Jos\u00e9 Luis Clerc wore the brand's tennis products. The first sponsorship agreements in football were signed with players (Dino Zoff and Ruud Gullit) and teams, such as Milan (1993\u201398), the Dutch national team, Napoli (1994\u201397), Juventus (2000\u201303), Chievo and Spanish club Real Zaragoza. Professional footballers provided input in both the design and fine-tuning of the products. This involvement together with the athletes' public images helped make the company a leader in tennis and football. During this same period, Lotto expanded into the export market, and its international business grew rapidly. Ten years later, the brand was being distributed in more than 60 countries around the world. In June 1999, the company was taken over by VINAY BMS, a group of local business people who were already very active in the sports area. The company was renamed Lotto Sport Italia. Today, Lotto distributes its products in more than 70 countries through independent sports stores, specialty chain stores and large stores with sports departments; the brand used on wristwatches is Lotto Time.[1] The company is pushing the development of corner and flagship stores, which are now widespread in Italy and in other countries.[2] Lotto today distributes its products in over 110 different countries, through independent sports article stores, specialized chain-stores and large stores with specialized sports departments. Special emphasis is placed on monobrand stores (flagship stores, street stores, factory outlets) as well as corners and shop-in-shops.

Its best known brands are Ray-Ban, Persol, and Oakley. Luxottica also makes sunglasses and prescription frames for designer brands such as Chanel, Prada, Giorgio Armani, Burberry, Versace, Dolce and Gabbana, Miu Miu and Tory Burch.[6][7][8][5] In January 2017, Luxottica announced a merger with Essilor.[9] The combined entity would command more than one quarter of global value sales of eyewear.[10][5] In March 2018, the European Commission unconditionally approved the merger of Essilor and Luxottica.[11] On October 1, 2018 the new holding company EssilorLuxottica was born, resulting in combined market capitalization of approximately \u20ac57\u00a0billion. Leonardo Del Vecchio started the company in 1961,[12] in Agordo north of Belluno, Italy; today the company is headquartered in Milan.[5] Del Vecchio began his career as the apprentice to a tool and die maker in Milan, but decided to turn his metalworking skills to making spectacle parts. So in 1961, he moved to Agordo in the province of Belluno, which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry.[13] The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership with Del Vecchio as one of the founding partners.[13] In 1967, he started selling complete eyeglass frames under the Luxottica brand, which proved successful enough that by 1971 he ended the contract manufacturing business.[14] Convinced of the need for vertical integration, in 1974, he acquired Scarrone, a distribution company.[13] In 1981, the company set up its first international subsidiary, in Germany, the first in a rapid period of international expansion.[13] The first of many licensing deals with a designer was struck with Armani, in 1988.[15] The company listed in New York in 1990,[16] and in Milan in December 2000,[17] joining the MIB-30 (now FTSE MIB) index in September 2003.[18] The listing raised money for the company and allowed it to use its shares to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue Eyewear in 1990, Persol and the United States Shoe Corporation (LensCrafters) in 1995, Ray-Ban in 1999 and Sunglass Hut, Inc. in 2001.[13] Luxottica later increased its presence in the retail sector by acquiring Sydney-based OPSM in 2003, Pearle Vision and Cole National in 2004.[19] Luxottica acquired Oakley in November 2007 for US$2.1 billion. Oakley had tried to dispute their prices because of Luxottica's large marketshare, and Luxottica responded by dropping Oakley from their stores, causing their stock price to drop, followed by Luxottica's hostile take over of the company.[20] In August 2011, Luxottica acquired Erroca for \u20ac20 million.[21] In March 2014, it was announced that Luxottica would partner with Google on the development of Google Glass and its integration into Luxottica's eyewear.[22] On 1 September 2014, a new organizational structure was announced, composed of two co-CEOs, one focusing on market development and the other overseeing corporate functions. After the exit of former CEO Andrea Guerra, Enrico Cavatorta was appointed CEO of Corporate Function and Interim CEO of Market (until new and permanent appointment to this role).[23][24][25] Cavatorta left the company 40 days after being appointed CEO. In 2016, it was reported that Luxottica had lost its third chief executive in a year and a half as Adil Mehboob-Khan stepped down a year after he replaced Cavatorta.[26] In January 2017, the company agreed on a merger with Essilor.[27] The deal also offered a succession plan for Leonardo Del Vecchio, the company's founder.[28] Shortly before the merger completed, reporter Sam Knight wrote in The Guardian, \"in seven centuries of spectacles, there has never been anything like it. The new entity will be worth around $50bn (\u00a337bn), sell close to a billion pairs of lenses and frames every year, and have a workforce of more than 140,000 people.\"[29] On October 1, 2018 the new holding company EssilorLuxottica was founded, resulting in combined market capitalization of approximately \u20ac57\u00a0billion. In August 2018, Luxottica restored Accademia Bridge in Venice.[30] Luxottica's two main product offerings are sunglasses and prescription frames. The company operates in two sectors: manufacturing & wholesale distribution, and retail distribution.[31] The house brands include the following:[32][33] The company also makes eyewear under license for the following designer labels:[32][33] These brands are sold in the company's own shops, as well as to independent distributors such as department stores, duty-free shops, and opticians.[5] Luxottica Retail has approximately 9,000 retail locations[35] in the United States, Latin America, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates.[19] The headquarters of the retail division is in Mason, Ohio, United States (North America).[19] Their retail banners include the following:[36] John Lewis Opticians (in Partnership with John Lewis and Parthers department stores) Luxottica is the largest optical retailer in the United States, with 7.3% of US retail sales in 2015.[38] With its merger with Essilor in 2018 the company owns Coastal/Clearly, an online contacts and glasses retail giant bought in 2014 that ships to over 200 countries beside its original North American market. Luxottica also owns EyeMed Vision Care, a managed vision care organization in the United States.[39] As of 2014, it is the second largest vision benefits company in the United States.[40][41][42] The company has been criticised for the high price of its brand-name glasses, such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, and several others. A 2012 60 Minutes segment focused on whether the company's extensive holdings in the industry were used to keep prices high. Luxottica owns not only a large portfolio of brands (over a dozen[43]) such as Ray-Ban and Oakley but also retailers such as Sunglass Hut and Oliver Peoples, the optical departments at Target and Sears, as well as key eye insurance groups including the second largest glasses insurance firm in the US. It has been accused of operating a complete monopoly on the optical industry and overcharging for its products\u2014for example, temporarily dropping competitor Oakley from its frame design list, then, when the company stock crashed, purchasing the company, then increasing the prices of its Ray-Ban sunglasses. In addition, it has been argued that, by owning the vision insurance company EyeMed, it also controls part of the buyers' market as well.[41] The company has said that the market is highly competitive, and that their frames account for ~10% of sales worldwide and ~20% in the United States.[44][43] Euromonitor International estimated that Luxottica's market share was 14% worldwide, with the second-largest company in the industry, Essilor, holding a 13% market share. The third-largest player was Johnson & Johnson, with a 3.9% market share. In October 2018, Luxottica and Essilor merged into a single company, EssilorLuxottica, which now occupies nearly 30% of the global market share and represents almost a billion pairs of lenses and frames sold annually.[45] The HBO series Last Week Tonight with John Oliver has criticized the company as a prominent instance of corporate consolidation,[46] as has the TruTV series Adam Ruins Everything. In 2019, LensCrafters founder E. Dean Butler spoke to the Los Angeles Times, admitting that Luxottica's dominance of the eyewear industry had resulted in price markups of nearly 1,000%. In the interview, Butler noted \"You can get amazingly good frames, with a Warby Parker level of quality, for $4 to $8. For $15, you can get designer-quality frames, like what you\u2019d get from Prada.\u201d When told that some eyeglasses cost as much as $800 in the United States, Butler remarked, \u201cI know. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s a complete rip-off.\u201d[47][48] The list of Luxottica shareholders with more than 2% of holdings, represented by voting shares at 23 December 2014.[49] In September 2012, Delfin S.a.r.l. reduced its share of Luxottica from 66% to 62.1%,[50] but later increased its share to 66% again.

In 2010 Manfrotto established the Manfrotto School of Xcellence, an educational resource to support and help everyone to get closer to photography and videography. Lino Manfrotto, an Italian photojournalist, began designing and selling light stands, booms, and telescopic rods under the name \"Manfrotto\" in the late 1960s. In 1972 Lino Manfrotto met Gilberto Battocchio, a technician working for a Bassano mechanical firm. With the collaboration, the company introduced its first tripod in 1974. By 1986 Manfrotto already had six manufacturing plants in Bassano, and in the following two years they would build five more plants in Villapaiera, the industrial zone of Feltre.[2] Vitec Group Plc. purchased Manfrotto in 1989, followed by the French company Gitzo in 1992 and the American company Bogen Photo Corp. in 1993.[3] Vitec Group Plc. chose to maintain the brands as separate lines in its portfolio. Manfrotto products are distributed in Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States by Manfrotto Distribution. In Canada, Manfrotto products are distributed by Gentec International. Lino Manfrotto died on February 5, 2017, at the age of 80.[4] In 2010 Manfrotto changed its brand slogan from \"Manfrotto Proven Professional\" to \"Manfrotto Imagine More\".[2] In May 2011 Manfrotto launched an online competition asking people to share short posts about imagination on Twitter and Facebook for the Manfrotto Imagine More Manifesto,[5] as well as to submit pictures representing imagination on the Manfrotto Imagine More website.[6] A short film was then created based around the winning posts and pictures, debuting at the 68th Venice International Film Festival.[7] In July 2012 Manfrotto launched the Manfrotto Imagine More blog, a web resource with tips on how to get the best out of pictures and how to share them with other people more effectively.[8] Manfrotto's main competition is from such brands as Benro, Slik and Velbon on the full range, and on the high end from Miller and Gitzo (which, as noted above, is part of the same group).

MAPEI commenced business on February 12, 1937, with a three-person workforce. Under Squinzi's guidance, MAPEI expanded its manufacturing to adhesives for laying floors and floor coverings. The company's first adhesives were for linoleum, later followed by ceramic tile, stone, carpet, PVC and wood. As the flooring industry grew, especially the Italian ceramic tile market, MAPEI recognized a need for setting materials that would make tile installation faster and more secure, and developed products accordingly. Under Rodolfo's son, Giorgio Squinzi, an industrial chemistry graduate, MAPEI has become a leading manufacturer of mortars, adhesives, grouts, sealants, waterproofing agents, additives for concrete and other specialty products for the building industry. MAPEI remains a family-owned and -operated business and is a privately held entity generating annual revenues of more than one billion euros. In the 1970s, MAPEI began expanding across Europe and, in 1978, into Canada, where MAPEI Inc. housed the first manufacturing plant outside of Italy. In 1983, Nicholas Di Tempora, a businessperson from Canada, partnered with Dr. Squinzi to create MAPEI Corporation in the United States. In the following years, Di Tempora increased MAPEI Corporation's locations throughout the United States. Operations in the Western Hemisphere are united under the banner of MAPEI Americas, consisting of affiliates and subsidiaries in Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, and South America. In 2000, headquarters were moved to Deerfield Beach, Florida, to centralize management of the various operations. Today, Di Tempora has retired from his position, and Luigi Di Geso serves as President and CEO of MAPEI Americas. Di Geso was formerly the General Manager of Mapei, Inc., the Canadian subsidiary of MAPEI Group. MAPEI reinvests 5% of its annual sales revenue into research and development of new products. The company's worldwide laboratories work on more than 150 new projects each year. Mapei Far East Pte Ltd was constituted in Singapore in 1989 as the regional headquarters for the development of Mapei business in the region. It started off as a commercial subsidiary with a modest area of 500m\u00b2 consisting of the warehouse and office. In 1995, the factory was established in one of Singapore\u2019s pioneer industrial zones in Tuas, Jurong, in the western part of Singapore. Total area is 10,000m\u00b2. Entering the third millennium in 2000 Mapei, after having established its reputation in Singapore as the world\u2019s leading producer of Adhesives, embarked on strategies for introducing their technologies as a leading player for a wide range of chemical products for construction. Mapei Far East commenced on the development of the Building Line and Admixtures. Subsequently, in 2003, the Underground Technology Team (U.T.T.) regional base was set up in Singapore. UTT offers a full range of technical service and products to the shotcrete and TBM tunnel industry. This was followed in 2006 by the setting up of the Cement Additives Division regional base to service the cement factories in this region. Established in 1989, Mapei UK Ltd moved to the West Midlands in 1999, and in 2004 moved to a new manufacturing facility in Halesowen, near Birmingham in the West Midlands. Mapei Vietnam commenced production in 2006 in the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone, Quang Nam Province. One technological improvement recently undertaken by MAPEI is its Fast-Track Ready technology. Identifying a need for completing speedy installations without compromising quality, MAPEI has developed products for the market that reduce the required steps of an installation and/or perform more quickly than current technology. More than 1,150 employees, at 15 locations in Canada, the United States, the Caribbean and South America, develop, produce, sell and support MAPEI products in the western hemisphere. Giorgio Squinzi, the former CEO of Mapei Group, which oversees worldwide operations, was a fan of road bicycle racing and under his leadership the company sponsored the highly successful Mapei cycling team in the 1990s, which included stars such as Tony Rominger, Abraham Olano, Johan Museeuw, Frank Vandenbroucke, Andrea Tafi, Michele Bartoli and Paolo Bettini.  The company also sponsored a development team which nurtured the younger generation of riders such as 3-time world time trial champion Michael Rogers, Fabian Cancellara, Filippo Pozzato, and many others. To increase the sport support, the company founded the Mapei Sport Center, a training center for endurance sports. Mapei also was a primary sponsor of NASCAR driver/owner Robby Gordon for several races for the 2007 NASCAR schedule. During the 2008 Sprint cup season Mapei sponsored the #7 of Robby Gordon at Kansas Motor Speedway. In 2009, Mapei will be the sponsor of the #7 Toyota driven by Robby Gordon in Phoenix, Daytona, Kansas, and Texas and also provided sponsorship on his #7 Dodge in the 2012 Daytona 500. Mapei owns and sponsors the Italian football team U.S. Sassuolo Calcio, who play in Serie A.[2] Mapei appointed Carlo Rossi as the chairman of the football club as in 2016\u201317 season. Mapei was a major sponsor of the 2015 UCI Road World Championships in Richmond, Virginia,[3] and of the 2016 UCI Road World Championships in Doha, Qatar.[4] ",

In 2008 the company was acquired by American automotive parts manufacturer Tenneco.[1] Up until the 1980s, Marzocchi were original equipment manufacturers ('OEM') for a number of Italian motorcycle marques including Moto Morini and Ducati, their oil shock absorbers also being OEM for Triumph Motorcycles in the latter stages of their production at the Meriden plant. Their later 'Strada' model introduced a degree of air suspension to motorcycling and, like the oil shocks, were available as aftermarket fittings for a large number of models. Strada units were OEM for Triumph's T140LE Royal Wedding and TSS models.  A big advantage of the Marzocchi shock was its ability to be rebuilt, seal kits and service manuals being readily available. Meriden also experimented with using Marzocchi front forks which were also used on some Italian models. Meriden however closed down before any such forks reached production models. Marzocchi shocks, albeit of more modern design, are still OEM for a number of manufacturers. Until 2007, fork production was based in Italy (apart from the entry level OEM parts, which are produced by the Taiwanese SRSunTour in Taiwan). Since 2008, all forks have been made in Taiwan.  ",

In 2005 Marzotto Group's textile business separated from Valentino Fashion Group. The Group manufactures woollen and cotton yarns for clothing, and through equity investments, woollen yarns for knitwear, linen yarns and silk. The Group manufactures in textile sector with the brands: In the linen yarns sector, Marzotto Group manufactures through the Linificio e Canapificio Nazionale of which the parent company owns 100% of the ordinary shares. The Woollen Yarns activity is manufactured through Filivivi. Activities are consolidated according to the proportional method; 50% owned by the parent company with Manifatture Lane Folco (Verzoletto Group). Luigi Marzotto founded a wool mill in Valdagno in 1836, but handed the business to his son Gaetano, Sr. in 1842. After the unification of the kingdom of Italy in 1861, Gaetano took advantage of the company's location (companies in northeast Italy were found to make the transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy more quickly than those in the south) by buying a spinning factory nearby Maglione. By then, the company's payroll had risen to over 1.200 employees. After Gaetano's death in 1910, Marzotto S.p.A. split in two, so his son Gaetano, Jr. took over the Maglione factory and his grandson Vittorio Emanuele Marzotto, who has been credited with leading the company into the export business, took over the Valdagno operations. In the 1950s, Marzotto S.p.A. diversified in the manufacturing of private-label menswear, Principe by Marzotto. After going public in 1961 with a listing on the Borsa Italiana, the Milan exchange market, the company started exporting its products to the United States. To reduce labour costs, 40 percent of the clothing production would eventually be transferred there. In the 1980s and 1990s, more and more companies were bought by Marzotto S.p.A.: Lanerossi in 1987, whose addition made Marzotto Europe's first fully integrated wool producer, Hugo Boss in 1991 and Czechoslovakia\u2019s Nov\u00e1 Mosilana wool mill in 1994. The company's grandest move came in 1997, when it announced that it would merge with HPI to form Gruppo Industriale Marzotto, the world's largest designer clothing manufacturer. However, in May of that year, Pietro Marzotto (son of Vittorio Emanuele, so great-great-grandson of Luigi), abruptly stopped negotiations, which led to Pietro's resignation of his function as chief executive and the take-over by Jean de Jaeger, the first non-Marzotto to be promoted to such a function. Pietro nonetheless remained the majority shareholder of Marzotto S.p.A. and he purchased Liteksas, a Lithuanian wool garments manufacturer, in 2000, so that the company could shift part of its production to the lower-cost market. He also bought Valentino S.p.A., which had been struggling under HPI, in 2003, and the company has seen surging profits and gaining sales ever since. ",

            "text": " Maserati (Italian:\u00a0[maze\u02c8ra\u02d0ti]) is an Italian luxury vehicle manufacturer. Established on 1 December 1914, in Bologna, Italy,[4] Maserati's tagline is \"Luxury, sports and style cast in exclusive cars\",[5] and mission statement is to \"Build ultra-luxury performance automobiles with timeless Italian style, accommodating bespoke interiors, and effortless, signature sounding power\".[6] The company's headquarters are now in Modena, and its emblem is a trident. It has been owned by the Italian-American car giant Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and FCA's Italian predecessor Fiat S.p.A. since 1993. Maserati was initially associated with Ferrari, which was also owned by FCA until being spun off in 2015, but more recently it has become part of the sports car group including Alfa Romeo and Abarth (see section below). In May 2014, due to ambitious plans and product launches, Maserati sold a record of over 3,000 cars in one month. This caused them to increase production of the Quattroporte and Ghibli models.[7] In addition to the Ghibli and Quattroporte, Maserati offers the Maserati GranTurismo, the GranTurismo Convertible, the Maserati Levante (the first ever Maserati SUV).[8] Maserati has placed a production output cap at 75,000 vehicles globally.[9] The Maserati brothers, Alfieri, Bindo, Carlo, Ettore, and Ernesto, were all involved with automobiles from the beginning of the 20th century. Alfieri, Bindo, and Ernesto built 2-litre Grand Prix cars for Diatto. In 1926, Diatto suspended the production of race cars, leading to the creation of the first Maserati and the founding of the Maserati marque. One of the first Maseratis, driven by Alfieri, won the 1926 Targa Florio. Maserati began making race cars with 4, 6, 8, and 16 cylinders (two straight-eights mounted parallel to one another). The trident logo of the Maserati car company, designed by Mario Maserati, is based on the Fountain of Neptune in Bologna's Piazza Maggiore. In 1920, one of the Maserati brothers, used this symbol in the logo at the suggestion of family friend Marquis Diego de Sterlich. It was considered particularly appropriate for the sports car company due to the fact that Neptune represents strength and vigour; additionally the statue is a characteristic symbol of the company's original home city.[10] Alfieri Maserati died in 1932, but three other brothers, Bindo, Ernesto, and Ettore, kept the firm going, building cars that won grand prix races. In 1937, the remaining Maserati brothers sold their shares in the company to the Adolfo Orsi family, who, in 1940, relocated the company headquarters to their home town of Modena,[4] where it remains to this day. The brothers continued in engineering roles with the company. Racing successes continued, even against the giants of German racing, Auto Union and Mercedes. In back-to-back wins in 1939 and 1940, an 8CTF won the Indianapolis 500, making Maserati the only Italian manufacturer ever to do so.[11] The second world war then intervened and Maserati abandoned car making to produce components for the Italian war effort. During this time, Maserati worked in fierce competition to construct a V16 town car for Benito Mussolini before Ferry Porsche of Volkswagen built one for Adolf Hitler. This failed, and the plans were scrapped. Once peace was restored, Maserati returned to making cars; the A6 series did well in the post-war racing scene. Key people joined the Maserati team. Alberto Massimino, a former Fiat engineer with both Alfa Romeo and Ferrari experience, oversaw the design of all racing models for the next ten years. With him joined engineers Giulio Alfieri, Vittorio Bellentani, and Gioacchino Colombo. The focus was on the best engines and chassis to succeed in car racing. These new projects saw the last contributions of the Maserati brothers, who, after their 10-year contract with Orsi expired, went on to form O.S.C.A.. This new team at Maserati worked on several projects: the 4CLT, the A6 series, the 8CLT, and, pivotally for the future success of the company, the A6GCS. The famous Argentinian grand prix driver Juan-Manuel Fangio raced for Maserati for a number of years in the 1950s, achieving a number of stunning victories including winning the world championship in 1957 in the 250F. Other racing projects in the 1950s were the 200S, 300S, 350S, and 450S, followed in 1961 by the famous Tipo 61. Maserati retired from factory racing participation because of the Guidizzolo tragedy[a] during the 1957 Mille Miglia, though they continued to build cars for privateers. Maserati became more and more focused on building road-going grand tourers. The 1957 3500 GT marked a turning point in the marque's history, as its first ground-up grand tourer design and first series-produced car. Production jumped from a dozen to a few hundred cars a year. Chief engineer Giulio Alfieri took charge of the project and turned the 3.5-litre inline six from the 350S into a road-going engine. Launched with a Carrozzeria Touring 2+2 coup\u00e9 aluminium body over superleggera structure, a steel-bodied short wheelbase Vignale 3500 GT Convertible open top version followed in 1960. The 3500 GT's success, with over 2,200 made, was critical to Maserati's survival in the years following withdrawal from racing. The 3500 GT also provided the underpinnings for the small-volume V8-engined 5000 GT, another seminal car for Maserati. Born from the Shah of Persia's whim of owning a road car powered by the Maserati 450S racing engine, it became one of the fastest and most expensive cars of its days. The third to the thirty-fourth and last example produced were powered by Maserati's first purely road-going V8 engine design. In 1962, the 3500 GT evolved into the Sebring, bodied by Vignale and based on the Convertibile chassis. Next came the two-seater Mistral coup\u00e9 in 1963 and Spider in 1964, both six-cylinder powered and styled by Pietro Frua. Also in 1963, the company's first saloon arrived, the Quattroporte, also styled by Frua. If the 5000 GT inaugurated the marque's first road-going V8, the Quattroporte's Tipo 107 4.2-litre DOHC V8 was the forefather of all Maserati V8s up to 1990. The Ghia-designed Ghibli coup\u00e9 was launched in 1967. It was powered by a 4.7-litre dry sump version of Maserati's quad cam V8. The Ghibli Spyder and 4.9-litre Ghibli SS followed. In 1968, Maserati was taken over by Citro\u00ebn. Adolfo Orsi remained the nominal president, but Maserati was controlled by its new owner. The relationship started as a joint venture, made public in January 1968,[12] in which Maserati would design and manufacture an engine for Citro\u00ebn's upcoming flagship called SM. Launched in 1970, the SM was a four-seat front-wheel-drive coup\u00e9, powered by a Maserati Tipo C114 2.7-litre 90\u00b0 V6 engine; this engine and its gearbox had been used in other vehicles, such as rally-prepared DSs used by Bob Neyret in Bandama Rally, and in the Ligier JS2. With secure financial backing, new models were launched and built in much greater numbers than years prior. Citro\u00ebn borrowed Maserati's expertise and engines for the SM and other vehicles, and Maserati incorporated Citro\u00ebn's technology, particularly in hydraulics. Engineer Giulio Alfieri was key to many of the ambitious designs of this period. The first new arrival was the 1969 Indy\u2014a Vignale-bodied four-seater GT with a traditional V8 drivetrain, 1,100 units of the Indy were made.  In 1971, the Bora was the company's first series production mid-engine model, an idea agreed with administrator Guy Malleret shortly after the 1968 takeover. The Bora ended Maserati's reputation for producing fast but technologically out of date cars, being the first Maserati with four wheel independent suspension.[citation needed] In contrast, competitor Lamborghini had used independent suspension in 1964.[13] In 1972, the Bora was transformed to the Merak, not employed a Tipo 114 SM-derived V6 enlarged to 3.0-litres.[14] Citro\u00ebn never developed a 4-door version of the SM - instead Maserati developed the Quattroporte II, which shared most of its mechanical parts with the SM, including the mid-engine, front-wheel-drive layout, and six headlight arrangement.[15] To power this large car, Alfieri developed a V8 engine from the SM's V6 rated at 260\u00a0PS (190\u00a0kW; 260\u00a0hp) and fitted it to a lightly modified SM, proving the chassis could easily handle the power increase.[16] Citro\u00ebn's and Maserati's financial difficulties hampered the type homologation process; the development costs for the stillborn saloon further aggravated Maserati's situation. Only a dozen Quattroporte IIs were ever produced, all with the V6. The replacement for the successful Ghibli was the Bertone-designed Khamsin, a front-engine grand tourer introduced in 1972 and produced until 1974;[citation needed] it combined the traditional Maserati V8 GT layout with modern independent suspension, unibody construction, and refined Citro\u00ebn technologies such as DIRAVI power steering. Meanwhile, the 1973 oil crisis put the brakes on the ambitious expansion of Maserati; demand for fuel-hungry sports cars and grand tourers shrank drastically. Austerity measures in Italy meant that the domestic market contracted by 60-70%.[17] All of the main Italian GT car manufacturers were heavily affected, having to lay off workers in order to empty lots of unsold cars. Maserati received the hardest blow, as its home market sales accounted for over half of the total\u2014in contrast with Ferrari's 20%.[18] In this situation, the only Maserati automobile that continued to sell in appreciable numbers was the small-displacement Merak. In 1974, with the 1973\u201375 recession at its climax, things took a turn for the worse. Citro\u00ebn went bankrupt and its incorporation into PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn begun. The year closed with domestic sales tumbling from 1973's 360 to 150 units,[18] and losses exceeding the share capital. On 22 May 1975, a press release from Citro\u00ebn management abruptly announced Maserati had been put into liquidation.[19] The workforce immediately picketed the factory, but production was not halted. Trade unions, the mayor of Modena, and local politicians mobilised to save the 800 jobs; industry minister Carlo Donat-Cattin even flew to Paris to meet Citro\u00ebn chairman Francois Rollier. An agreement was reached in June,[20] after several meetings and assemblies. During one of these meetings, Citro\u00ebn liquidators disclosed that a possible Italian buyer had showed up, and the name of Alejandro de Tomaso was put forth for the first time.[21] Citro\u00ebn accepted to suspend liquidation as requested by the Italian government, which on its part guaranteed six months of special redundancy fund to pay the salaries. On 8 August 1975, an agreement was signed at the Ministry of Industry in Rome, and property of Maserati passed from Citro\u00ebn to Italian state-owned holding company GEPI[b] and Alejandro de Tomaso, an Argentinian industrialist and former racing driver, became president and CEO.[22][23] As of December 1979, GEPI's quota amounted to 88.75% of Maserati,[24] the remaining 11.25% stake was being controlled by de Tomaso through a holding company which grouped his automotive interests in Maserati and Innocenti. Beginning in 1976, new models were introduced, sharing their underpinnings\u2014but not their engines\u2014with De Tomaso cars; first came the Kyalami grand tourer, derived from the De Tomaso Longchamp, restyled by Frua and powered by Maserati's own V8. Following the Kyalami was the Giugiaro-designed Quattroporte III based on the De Tomaso Deauville, which was introduced in 1976 and put on sale in 1979. The Bora's sales dwindled down; the Khamsin was discontinued between 1982 and 1983. Progressively stripped of its Citro\u00ebn-derived parts, the Merak continued to sell over one hundred units a year, until 1982. The 1980s saw the company largely abandoning the mid-engine sports car in favour of a compact front-engine, rear-drive coup\u00e9, the Biturbo.[25] Of fairly conventional construction, the Biturbo's pleasure and pain was its twin-turbocharged V6 engine, the first for a production car. This engine, descending from Alfieri's 90\u00b0 V6, was fitted in a large number of models, all sharing key components; every new Maserati launched up to the 1990s would derive from the Biturbo's platform. The Biturbo family was extremely successful at exploiting the aspirational image of the Maserati name\u2014selling 40,000 units. In 1983 and 1984, the range was extended to include saloons (the 425 and 420) and a cabriolet (the Zagato-bodied Spyder), respectively on a long and short wheelbase of the Biturbo platform. During 1984, Chrysler bought a 5% share in Maserati. Following an agreement between De Tomaso's friend and Chrysler head Lee Iacocca, a joint venture was signed. Maserati would go on to produce a car for export to the American market, the Chrysler TC by Maserati, with Chrysler-sourced engines. In July of that same year, a merger between Maserati and Nuova Innocenti was decided; it was carried out in 1985.[26] Chrysler upped its stake to 15.6% by underwriting three quarters of a 75 billion Lire capital raise in 1986.[27] New Biturbo-based cars and model evolutions were launched year after year. In 1984, it was the 228, a large coup\u00e9 built on the long wheelbase saloon chassis, with a new 2.8-litre version of the twin-turbocharged V6. Weber Fuel injection was phased in starting in 1986, bringing improved reliability and a host of new model variants. The same year, the ageing Quattroporte III was updated and marketed as the luxurious Royale, built to order in an handful of examples a year; its discontinuation in 1990 marked the disappearance of Maserati's four-cam V8 engine, a design that could trace its roots back to the 450S racer and the legendary 5000 GT. In 1987, the 2.8-litre 430 topped the saloon range. 1988 brought the Karif, a two-seater, based on the short wheelbase Spyder chassis. Meanwhile, the Biturbo name was dropped altogether, as updated coup\u00e9s and saloons were updated and became the 222 and 422.  1989 marked the reintroduction of an eight-cylinder grand tourer: the Shamal, built on a modified short wheelbase Biturbo chassis, clad in new muscular bodywork styled by Marcello Gandini. It was powered by an all-new twin-turbocharged 32-valve V8 engine paired to a 6-speed gearbox. 2.0-litre, 24-valve V6 engines were also added to the Shamal range. In October 1989, De Tomaso bought the remaining GEPI quota. In December, Fiat entered in Maserati's history. Maserati and Innocenti were separated; Innocenti Milano S.p.A., the company that sold Innocenti cars, continued its business under a 51% Fiat Auto ownership. All of the Modena and Lambrate plants went to a newly created company, the still existent Maserati S.p.A.; 49% of it was owned by Fiat Auto and 51% was controlled by De Tomaso through the old company, Officine Alfieri Maserati.[28][29] In the early '90s, a mid-engine sports car was developed, the Chubasco\u2014which was to d\u00e9but in 1992. It featured Gandini-designed body, a V8 powertrain, and a backbone chassis. The project was cancelled, as it proved too expensive. Starting in 1990, the entire range of the Biturbo received a facelift designed by Marcello Gandini, on the lines of the Shamal's styling. The last version of the Biturbo coup\u00e9 was called  Racing. It was a transitional model in which several features to be found on the upcoming Ghibli were tested. The Ghibli II was introduced in 1992. It was a six-cylinder coup\u00e9, with modified Biturbo underpinnings dressed by new Gandini bodywork (toned down from the Shamal) and the latest evolution of the 24-valve twin-turbocharged V6 with record breaking specific output. The underpinnings of the stillborn Chubasco gave birth to the Maserati Barchetta, a small open top mid-engine sports car styled by Synthesis Design's Carlo Gaino.[30] A one-make racing series was held in 1992 and 1993, using the Barchetta Corsa racing version; the road-going Barchetta Stradale was never put into production. Just 17 units of the Barchetta were produced. Between 1992 and 1994, all models save for the Ghibli and Shamal were progressively discontinued. On 19 May 1993, 17 years after having rescued it from liquidation, Alejandro De Tomaso sold his 51% stake in Maserati to Fiat, which became the sole owner.[23][31] Substantial investments were made in Maserati, and it has since undergone something of a renaissance.[citation needed] In 1998, a new chapter began in Maserati's history when the company launched the 3200 GT. This two-door coup\u00e9 is powered by a 3.2\u00a0L twin-turbocharged V8 derived from the Shamal engine, which is rated at 370 horsepower (280\u00a0kW). Over two decades after the ill-fated Chrysler TC by Maserati during Chrysler's brief ownership stake in Maserati, the two companies became interconnected again when Fiat purchased majority control of Chrysler in 2011 as a result of Chrysler's bankruptcy. In July 1997, Fiat sold a 50% share in the company to Maserati's long-time arch-rival Ferrari (Ferrari itself being owned by Fiat).[4] In 1999, Ferrari took full control, making Maserati its luxury division. A new factory was built, replacing the existing 1940s-era facility. Ferrari is credited for bringing Maserati back into business, after many lacklustre years of Maserati teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.[citation needed] The last links to the de Tomaso era were cut in 2002, when the 3200 GT was replaced by the Maserati Coup\u00e9 and Spyder; evolved from the 3200, these cars used an all-new, naturally aspirated, dry sump 4.2-litre V8 with a transaxle gearbox. In turn Coup\u00e9 and Spyder were replaced by the GranTurismo and GranCabrio. Meanwhile, two new models have been shown to the public: the MC12 road supersports and successful GT racer with a Ferrari Enzo\u2013derived chassis and engine and the new Quattroporte, a luxury saloon with the 4.2-litre V8 engine of the Gran Turismo.[32] Nowadays, Maserati is back in business and successfully selling automobiles on a global basis. In 2001, Ferrari decided to change all of the old tooling and installed high-tech devices in the Modena factory, making it one of the most advanced in the world.[citation needed] Since early 2002, Maserati once again entered the United States market,[33] which has quickly become its largest market worldwide. The company has also re-entered the racing arena with their Trofeo and, in December 2003, the MC12 (formerly known as the MCC), which was developed according to FIA GT regulations and has since competed with great success in the world FIA GT championship, winning the teams championship three consecutive times from 2005 to 2007. The MC12 has also been raced in various national GT championship as well as in the American Le Mans series. The MC12 is based on the Enzo Ferrari sports car;[34] 50 street-legal homologation models (roadsters and coup\u00e9s) have been sold for about US$700,000 each. The Maserati and Alfa Romeo group, under Fiat Group, started in 2005, when Maserati was split off from Ferrari and partnered with Alfa Romeo.[35][36] On 9 June 2005, the 20,000th Maserati, a Quattroporte V, left the factory.[37] In the second quarter of 2007, Maserati made profit for the first time in 17 years under Fiat ownership.[38] On January 22, 2010, Fiat announced that it had created a new partnership/brand group for Alfa Romeo, Maserati, and Abarth. The group was led by Harald J. Wester, the current CEO of Maserati. Sergio Marchionne said that \"[the] purpose of bringing the Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Abarth brands under the same leadership is to emphasize and leverage the value of the shared qualities of the three brands in terms of their sporting characteristics and performance.\"[39] Abarth stayed under Wester's leadership until 2013, leaving Maserati and Alfa Romeo in the brand group, led by Wester.[40] Although Maserati and Alfa Romeo are in a brand group, Alfa Romeo is structured under FCA Italy S.p.A., which itself is structured under FCA, whereas Maserati is structured solely under FCA. In addition, in an interview with Wester in 2015, he clarified that his \"role at Maserati is different from that in the Alfa Romeo as the latter is better integrated into the Fiat Group\" and that \"the new Alfa car won't share any parts with the current Maserati model. I'm not planning any technical merging of these two makes.\"[41] In 2013, Maserati started its expansion with the Quattroporte VI, which was designed to better compete with the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. This was followed by the introduction of the Ghibli, which was slated to compete against the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series. On May 6, 2014, Maserati confirmed production of the Levante SUV and the Alfieri (previously a 2+2 concept sports car that was named after Alfieri Maserati). The Alfieri hasn't started production as of yet.[8] At this event, it was revealed that 2014 will be the last year of production for the GranTurismo and GranTurismo Convertible,[8] although production of the GranTurismo was extended until 2016, with a facelifted GranTurismo still being unveiled in 2018.[8][42] In a 2015 interview, Harald J. Wester said that there was room for a future sports car, positioned above the Alfieri.[41] Along with their expansion, Maserati started their re-entrance into the high-performance car field, in order to compete with brands such as Mercedes-AMG, BMW M, Porsche, Jaguar, and in certain cases, Ferrari. This is being done with Maserati models that have high power output engines, higher performance components, and better handling. The top-of-the-line variants of the Quattroporte VI, Ghibli, and Levante have 570\u00a0PS (419\u00a0kW; 562\u00a0hp) V8 engines with all-wheel drive, in order to better compete with their respective AMGs, M cars, Jaguars, and Porsches.[6][43]  In addition, Harald J. Wester stated that Maserati was experimenting with plug-in hybrid powertrains, and that one would be offered in the second half of 2017 in the Levante SUV.[41] By 2018, the base Ghibli will have received a performance upgrade 350\u00a0bhp (261\u00a0kW; 355\u00a0PS), and the Ghibli S Q4 to 450\u00a0bhp (336\u00a0kW; 456\u00a0PS).[6] Maserati sales in 2013 was 15,400 units, which is up from just over 6,000 units worldwide in 2012 (2013 included the release of the new Quattroporte and Ghibli towards the end of the year, and thus the first year to fully represent the sales inclusive of these models is 2014).[8] In May, 2014, Maserati sold a company record of over 3,000 cars worldwide, causing them to increase production of the Ghibli and Quattroporte.[44] For that same month in the United States, Maserati sold 1,114 vehicles, which is up 406.19% over the same month in the previous year in the United States.[45] Maserati's best month of sales in the United States was September 2014, with 1,318 units sold.[46] The month in 2014 where the increase on sales for the same month of the previous year was the highest was May, with a volume increase of 406.19%.[46] The sales target for 2018 was 75,000 units worldwide.[8] 2014 marked a historic record of 13,411 total units sold in North America for the year, a 169% increase versus 2013, boasting the highest-ever overall sales year for Maserati North America, Inc.[47] Worldwide, in 2014 Maserati sold about 36,500 cars, a 136% increase over 2013.[48] Harald J. Wester stated that Maserati would not surpass the 70,000 sales per year mark, and that Maserati would maintain its current position in the higher end of the luxury sports car market, rather than expanding downmarket and making vehicles smaller and less expensive than the Ghibli and Levante (such as those similar to the Audi Q5 and Mercedes-Benz C-Class), as other FCA brands, specifically Alfa Romeo, are in those market spaces.[41] Since 2009, Marco Tencone was the head designer of Maserati cars, although, in late 2015, he was announced as remaining in executive positions at Lancia and Fiat only.[49] Italian for \"four-door,\" the Maserati Quattroporte is a sports luxury saloon. The sixth generation of the Quattroporte was introduced in 2013. The Quattroporte is currently available in S Q4, GTS and Diesel trim. The S Q4 has an advanced four wheel drive system, and a 404-horsepower twin-turbochrged V6 engine.[50] The GTS is rear wheel drive, and has a 523-horsepower V8.[51] A Quattroporte Diesel model is offered on selected markets, rated at 275 horsepower (250\u00a0hp in Italy) and 442\u00a0ft-lbs of torque. The sixth-generation of the Quattroporte has grown in size in order to better compete with the roomier luxury saloons like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.[52]  Since 2018, the Quattroporte S Q4 has been upgraded and is now rated at 456\u00a0PS (335\u00a0kW; 450\u00a0hp) from its V6, and the GTS is rated at 568\u00a0PS (418\u00a0kW; 560\u00a0hp), both with all-wheel drive (for the V8 to increase performance).[53]The first presentation of the Ghibli was on 20 April 2013 in Shanghai. It is a sports executive saloon that competes against the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes E-Class and Audi A6. The car, along with the new Quattroporte, is built in the Italian factory of Grugliasco, Turin (former Bertone). The base Ghibli is rated at 330 horsepower, the Ghibli Diesel at 275 horsepower (also 250 in Italy only), and the Ghibli S Q4 at 410 horsepower. Since 2018, the base Ghibli is rated at 350 horsepower and the S Q4 at 450 horsepower.[6] The Maserati GranTurismo is a grand tourer introduced in 2007. The GranTurismo has a 4.7-litre V8, rated at 460\u00a0PS (338\u00a0kW; 454\u00a0hp) in Sport trim and for the MC Stradale. A convertible (GranCabrio) version is also available in standard, Sport, and MC models. The final production year for the Maserati GranTurismo was scheduled to be 2014, but it was revived in 2018 with a 568\u00a0PS (418\u00a0kW; 560\u00a0hp) V8, again in rear wheel drive form.[8] The Maserati Levante is a crossover SUV introduced in 2014. It has been anticipated with the Maserati Kubang concept SUV in September 2003 at the Frankfurt Motor Show and again in 2011. It was announced, at the Paris Motor Show held in Paris in September 2012. The Levante is assembled in Mirafiori Plant, in Turin. Production was confirmed on May 6, 2014.[8] The Levante is offered with a 3.0-litre V6 rated at either 350 or 425 horsepower states of tune. All models have all-wheel drive.[6] The Maserati Alfieri is a concept 2+2 presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2014. The concept was based on the lighter chassis of the GranTurismo MC Stradale, although it had a shorter wheelbase. The concept was introduced with a 4.7 litre V8 rated at 468\u00a0PS (344\u00a0kW; 462\u00a0hp). The Alfieri was confirmed for production in 2016 at a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles event on May 6, 2014.[8] The production version will have three different V6 engine choices, rated at 418\u00a0PS (307\u00a0kW; 412\u00a0hp), 456\u00a0PS (335\u00a0kW; 450\u00a0hp), and 528\u00a0PS (388\u00a0kW; 521\u00a0hp), respectively.[8] The 450 horsepower and 520 horsepower versions only have an all-wheel drive system. Though as of yet, production has not begun.[8] Throughout its history, Maserati has participated in various forms of motorsports including Formula One, sportscar racing and touring car racing, both as a works team and through private entrants. Notable drivers include Juan Manuel Fangio and Prince Bira of Siam. Maserati developed fifteen GranTurismo MC racecars, homologated for the European Cup and National Endurance Series, one of which was raced by GT motorsport organization Cool Victory in Dubai in January, 2010.[73] Coordinates: 44\u00b038\u203257\u2033N 10\u00b056\u203227\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff44.6493\u00b0N 10.9408\u00b0E\ufeff / 44.6493; 10.9408 ",

It was established in 1951 in Reggio Emilia by Achille Maramotti (7 January 1927 \u2013 12 January 2005). In March 2008, the company had 2,254 stores in 90 countries.[1] It sponsors the Max Mara Art Prize for Women. Achille Maramotti began designing couture clothing in 1947, and officially established the House of Max Mara in 1951. The \"Mara\" came from his surname, while \"Max\" referred to Count Max, a local character who was seldom sober but always stylish.[2] Maramotti was one of the first to see that the future of fashion lay in the mass production of designer-quality clothes.  He was also keen to emphasise the brand of Max Mara ahead of the names of individual designers, even though he employed Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Dolce & Gabbana, Narciso Rodriguez[1] and Anne Marie Beretta.[3] The company remains in the hands of the family.[1] Max Mara has spawned 35 labels,[2] although Max Mara womenswear remains the core of the company. Other brands include Sportmax, Sportmax Code, Weekend Max Mara, Marella, Pennyblack, iBlues, MAX&Co. (the trendy, youth division), and Marina Rinaldi. This last, founded in 1980 and named after Achille Maramotti's great grandmother, is one of the best-known: in her obituary of Maramotti for The Independent.[4][5] As of July 17, 2013, Jennifer Garner is the first celebrity spokesperson for Max Mara.[6][7] Starting in September 2013, the campaign appears in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, W, InStyle, The New York Times, and the International Herald Tribune.[7] Achille Maramotti was born on January 7, 1927 in Reggio Emilia in Italy.

            "text": "Mediobanca is an Italian investment bank founded in 1946 at the initiative of Raffaele Mattioli (at that time CEO of Banca Commerciale Italiana, the largest commercial bank in Italy which promoted its incorporation together with Credito Italiano) and Enrico Cuccia to facilitate the post-World War II reconstruction of Italian industry. Cuccia led Mediobanca from 1946 to 1982. Today, it is an international banking group with offices in Milan, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Luxembourg, New York and Paris. Mediobanca was set up to provide medium-term financing for manufacturers and establish a direct relationship between the banking sector and the investment needs of the reorganization of industry after the devastation caused by World War II. The Banking Act of 1936 established a clear separation between short term and medium-to-long term financing and the major banks had opted for specializing in short-term loans and there was the institution that would deal with financing for the flotation of companies that wished to obtain a stock market listing. In addition to granting consolidated loans against certificates of deposit and savings books, Mediobanca developed its activity of placement of bonds and shares issued by Italian companies. The professionalism developed by the bank under the, some would say brilliant, guidance of Enrico Cuccia enabled it to quickly acquire a position of leadership in the field of investment banking in Italy. In the mid-1950s, Mediobanca entered into agreements with important foreign partners (Lazard Group, Berliner H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft, Lehman Brothers, Sofina) that enabled the bank to play a role on the international market and obtained a Stock Exchange listing in 1956. Since its origins, Mediobanca has operated in collateral areas to the credit market, such as trust management (1948 with Spafid), the promotion of international trade (through trading companies mainly operating between Italy and Africa in the mid-1950s), consumer credit (in 1960 through the company Compass which had been set up ten years earlier to develop new initiatives with industrial partners), auditing (1961 with Reconta, which was the first Italian audit firm), leasing operations (1970 with Selma). The placement of securities of Italian companies on the domestic market and abroad led to the acquisition of small holdings which have increased over time reinvesting part of the profits. They became the bank\u2019s main real investment for the protection of its equity. These packages favored the retention of major customers, the most important being Assicurazioni Generali, Montedison, SNIA Viscosa, Pirelli and Fiat. In 1963, together with other banks and financial institutions, Mediobanca led the formation of the first shareholder syndicate to intervene in the capital of a company, Olivetti, with the objective of redefining its strategic purchases on several occasions of Generali shares led to the bank being its largest shareholder (currently 13%). There were numerous, equally important, operations with Montedison, Fiat, SNIA Viscosa and Italcementi. These and other firms operated with Mediobanca were commonly called the \u2018Northern Galaxy\u2019.[3] When Mediobanca was set up, the shareholders authorized Enrico Cuccia to operate using his own judgment and he kept the bank free from the political influences that gradually affected IRI, the public entity that controlled the three Italian banks of national interest that were Mediobanca\u2019s majority shareholders. 1982 saw the beginning of a period of intense friction with IRI under the presidency of Romano Prodi, when the three banks were instructed to discontinue Mr. Cuccia\u2019s mandate. Cuccia resigned as general manager by was elected to the Board by the shareholder Lazard while Mediobanca continued to be managed by two of his trusted aides, Silvio Salteri as CEO and Vincenzo Maranghi, his generally accepted \u201cheir\u201d. In 1988, when Antonio Maccanico took over the presidency, the conflict was settled and the bank was privatized by the setting up of a shareholders\u2019 syndicate with equal representation of banking groups (initially the three founding banks) and private groups. On that occasion the position of CEO went to Vincenzo Maranghi and Cuccia accepted his appointment as Honorary President maintaining a symbolic presence in the bank and performing strategic consultancy. After Antonio Maccanico, called to government posts, the presidency went to Francesco C\u00ecngano, who was Mattioli\u2019s successor in Banca Commerciale Italiana. The new banking law passed in 1993, abolished the specialization requirement allowing ordinary banks to enter the medium/long term credit market and generated a series of problems between Mediobanca and its banking partners, which ceased to be the almost exclusive channel for the placement of term deposits and bonds. In the changing context of the financial markets of the early 1990s, Mediobanca evolved by engaging more decisively in investment banking operations, creating a major diversification in the private banking business and expanding its consumer credit area, finally developing an international presence. In the 1990s, it was among the main players in the Italian program of privatization of large state-owned enterprises (the largest operations concerned Telecom Italia, Enel, Banca di Roma and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro), also contributing to foreign programs in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain. Its final and perhaps greatest coup was its decisive role in the 1999 takeover of Telecom Italia by Olivetti.[4] The deal was decided by the narrowest of margins with 51% of shareholders voting in favour of the deal.[5] Under Cuccia's leadership, which lasted until his death in 2000, the bank was widely described as \"secretive\"[6][7][8] despite being publicly traded: meetings with analysts or interviews with the media were not granted.[6] Mediobanca\u2019s core business is banking, which accounts for some 85% of the Group\u2019s total income and 60% of its net profit. With the set up of CheBanca! there has been further diversification among banking activities themselves, between corporate and retail; the split is 50:35 for revenues and 65:35 for lending. The Bank\u2019s funding sources are being expanded, and  as at 21 September 2010 the retail segment accounted for 18% of the total funding. Alongside its  banking activities Mediobanca also manages an equity investment portfolio, with stakes in leading Italian companies in the insurance, publishing and telecommunications sectors. The company has operations, itself and via subsidiaries, in the following segments: The death of Enrico Cuccia in June 2000 exacerbated tensions with the banking shareholders due to conflicts of interest, competition in the same markets and the central bank\u2019s hostility towards Mediobanca\u2019s management. In April 2003, Vincenzo Maranghi agreed to resign as long as the bank's independence was preserved. This was achieved by promoting two of his aides to top management positions, Alberto Nagel and Renato Pagliaro. They developed market operations more intensely (IPOs, M & A, trading of financial instruments), reducing the weight of historical shareholdings (some of which, like Fiat, were sold). They also achieved penetration of the main foreign markets, where the bank\u2019s presence was established through local professional teams. With the launch of Che Banca! in 2008, operations in the retail banking segment expanded creating a model of multi-channel distribution (Internet, call centers, branches) capable of providing substantial deposit flows.  While the years immediately following the resignation of Maranghi entailed the appointment of an external Presidency (Gabriele Galateri and Cesare Geronzi), subsequent events reestablished all the conditions guaranteeing the independence of the institution whose leadership today has Alberto Nagel as CEO and Renato Pagliaro as president. Since 2006 Mediobanca has embarked on an internationalization process with the aim of expanding its market base, diversifying counterparty risk and assisting its clients in their cross-border transactions. In Corporate and Investment Banking, Mediobanca has operations throughout continental Europe through branch offices opened in Paris (2004), Frankfurt (2007) and Madrid (2007). In these countries the Bank\u2019s strategy is to provide corporate finance activities through a wide range of corporate and leveraged finance, corporate lending, debt capital market and equity capital market services. The New York office performs brokerage and representative activities, while to complete the picture there are also representative offices located in Moscow and Luxembourg.[3] Since summer 2013 Mediobanca has had a footprint in Turkey through subsidiary Mediobanca Advisory.[5] The London branch office, set up in 2008, consists of specialist teams providing solutions to clients: Credit, Rates, FX, Alternatives and Equity Derivatives, Corporate Lending and Leveraged Finance, Equity research and Advisory. As well as its role as equity and derivatives platform, the London office is strategic in strengthening relations with hedge funds and private equity funds. Since 2014 the London office has also been home to the FIG EMEA team. ",

The Memphis group's work often incorporated plastic laminate and was characterized by ephemeral design featuring colorful and abstract decoration as well as asymmetrical shapes, sometimes arbitrarily alluding to exotic or earlier styles. On December 1, 1980, Ettore Sottsass organised a meeting with designers, and in 1981 formed a design collaborative named Memphis. The name was taken after the Bob Dylan song \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\" which had been played repeatedly throughout the evening's meeting. They drew inspiration from such movements as Art Deco and Pop Art, including styles such as the 1950s Kitsch and futuristic themes. The result was a highly acclaimed debut at the 1981 Salone del Mobile of Milan, a highly prestigious furniture design fair. The group produced and exhibited furniture and design objects, annually from 1981 until 1988. The group's colorful furniture has been described as \"bizarre\", \"misunderstood\", \"loathed\", and \"a shotgun wedding between Bauhaus and Fisher-Price\".[1] While created in the 1980s, the colourful geometric style became most popular and widely accepted in the 1990s, where it influenced the design of furniture, architecture, and household items. Memphis designs served as inspiration for the Fall/Winter 2011\u20132012 Christian Dior haute couture collection fashion show,[2] for the Winter 2015 Missoni collection,[3] and fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld collected Memphis pieces.[4] Musician David Bowie was also a major collector of Memphis; after his death in 2016, his collection was auctioned off at Sotheby's for a total of \u00a31,387,000.[5] ",

The project originated in Italy and is the first of its kind in the world. It was launched in May 2016 in the city of Florence and is supported  by Menarini with an investment of one million Euro. It foresees the creation of a network of 15.000 paediatricians and general practitioners deployed over the entire Italian territory who act as 'sentinels' in the fight against child abuse. These physicians, who have been 'trained' on the skills needed to recognise the unexpressed 'sentinel' warning signs of child abuse,  shall in turn become reference people for their colleagues on a local level, providing qualified information and advice.

It operated scheduled and charter flights to domestic, European and intercontinental destinations from several Italian bases. Some of its operations were carried out by the old Air Italy under the Meridiana brand. It was owned by Qatar Airways through AQA Holding (49%) and Alisarda S.p.A. (51%), who rebranded the airline as the new Air Italy effective 1 March 2018. The company was set up with the name of Alisarda on 29 March 1963 by Aga Khan Prince Kar\u012bm al-Hussayn\u012b with the aim of promoting tourism in Sardinia. Scheduled flights commenced in 1964. On 3 May 1991 in an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting, the name of the company was changed to Meridiana S.p.A., and a new logo was created. These changes were made to reflect the expansion of the company's operations to Europe. In December 2006, Meridiana acquired the majority package of the airline company Eurofly, with a 29,95% share. During the year, further important investments were made aiming to develop Meridiana, which also closed 2006 with the historical record of 4,6 million passengers carried with an approximate 15% increase compared to 2005. At the end of February 2010, Meridiana fly, the second-largest carrier in Italy, was created by the merger of Eurofly, a company specialized in long-haul charter flights to holiday destinations, and Meridiana, a scheduled operator of national and European flights, with the primary objective of connecting the main Italian airports with Sardinia and Sicily. In October 2011, Meridiana fly completely acquired Air Italy, an Italian charter airline. On 16 January 2013, the Board of Directors of Meridiana S.p.A. acknowledged the agreement for the purchase by Meridiana S.p.A. of all the Meridiana fly ordinary shares held by the former shareholders of Air Italy Holding S.r.l. Today the group is run by Meridiana S.p.A. Holding, which controls 89% of Meridiana fly including 100% of Air Italy; the remaining part is quoted to the Milan Stock Exchange but a tender offer was recently[when?] launched to delist the company. In April 2013, when the Air Italy merger was completed, Meridiana Fly returned to its former, shorter name, Meridiana.[2] On 16 May, it launched the new frequent-flyer program Meridiana Club in partnership with Avios. In mid-2013, Meridiana offered national and international scheduled flights from the main Italian airports to Sardinia (Olbia, Alghero and Cagliari), Sicily and Naples as well as holiday destinations such as the Canary Islands, Greece and the Red Sea. It also serviced the long-haul destinations of the Maldives, Mauritius, Kenya, Zanzibar, Santo Domingo and Brazil mainly from Milan Malpensa and/or Rome Fiumicino. In 2014, the airline continued to reposition its brand by launching international flights to Moscow Domodedovo, London Gatwick, Kiev, Tel Aviv and Nice from Naples and to Brussels, Geneva, London Gatwick, Tel Aviv, Nice, Hamburg, Paris CDG, Moscow Domodedovo and Kiev from Olbia; reconfirming its leadership in Sardinia and its focus on Naples, Catania, Milan Linate and Verona airport for domestic Italian flights. Since 18 November 2014 Meridiana Club frequent flyers have been able to earn Avios points on British Airways and from 23 March 2015 on Iberia. In December 2014, Meridiana retired its last Airbus aircraft, two A320-200s, to pursue the aim of operating an all Boeing fleet together with Air Italy.[3] In 2 September 2017 it was announced that Qatar Airways had bought 49% of AQA Holding, the new shareholder of Meridiana.[4] On 7 November 2017 it was announced that Qatar Airways would merge Air Italy with the current Meridiana subsidiary under the Meridiana AOC.[5] In December 2017, Meridiana announced a restructuring of its route network. While all routes from Milan-Linate except the services to its base in Olbia will be terminated, Meridiana will start year-round long-haul services from Milan-Malpensa to New York City and Miami using Airbus A330-200 aircraft inherited from Qatar Airways.[6] Meridiana further announced that it would become the first Italian airline to take delivery of Boeing 737 MAX 8s. It was also reported that new full-flat business class seats and in-flight Wi-fi would be installed on the new Airbus A330s to be received from Qatar Airways.[7] In February 2018, Meridiana rebranded as Air Italy and announced a plan to expand its fleet and destinations to become Italy's flagship carrier.[8] Meridiana's head offices are located at Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport in Olbia, Italy. AQA Holding is the parent company of Meridiana, which was founded on 2 September 2017 after Qatar Airways purchased a 49% stake in Meridiana, with Alisarda keeping the 51% stake that it previously owned, which subsequently created the new holding company. Meridiana currently has 3 subsidiaries. One subsidiaries Meridian owns is Meridiana Maintenance S.p.A (operated as Meridiana Maintenance). The airline maintenance company was founded after Meridiana merged with eurofly (another Italian airline). Their hangar is located at Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport in Olbia, Italy next to the Meridiana Head Offices. Wokita S.i.r (operated as Wokita) is another subsidiary Meridiana owns. Wokita is a tour operator that offers a wide and extensive range of tourism products such as package tours, flights, hotels and resorts in seaside areas, yachting and activity holidays since 2006. Since April 2013 Meridiana owned Air Italy (2005\u20132018) as its operate on behalf of Meridiana. Meridiana codeshared with the following airlines:[9] At the time of the merger, the Meridiana fleet consisted of the following aircraft:[10] In April 2017, it was announced that, due to Qatar Airways purchasing a stake in the airline, the airline is to complete a fleet modernization with 20 Boeing 737 MAX 8 to be delivered from the second quarter of 2018, taken from Qatar's orders from Boeing. In October 2017, it was announced that the airline would replace its long-haul fleet with new aircraft transferred from Qatar Airways' new orders. It was announced that the airline would operate a mix of Boeing 787 and Airbus A330.[11][12] The fleet development plan was later Transferred to Air Italy. Meridiana previously operated the following aircraft types: ",

It competed in the Formula One World Championship from 1985 until 2005 with little success, nevertheless acquiring a loyal following of fans. In 2001, to save the team from folding, Minardi sold it to Australian businessman Paul Stoddart, who ran the team for five years before selling it on to Red Bull GmbH in 2005 who renamed it Scuderia Toro Rosso.[1] From 2001, all of Minardi chassis are called \"PS\" then a number, the PS being the initials of team owner, Paul Stoddart. During its time in F1, the team scored a total of 38 championship points; 16 of these were earned by the team's first driver, Pierluigi Martini. Martini also recorded the team's only front row start, qualifying 2nd at the 1990 United States Grand Prix, and he led a lap during the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, the only time a Minardi led a lap. The team never achieved a podium finish, only managing three 4th-place finishes: Martini twice in 1991 and Christian Fittipaldi in 1993. In the 21 seasons, Minardi entered 37 drivers. Thirteen had Italian nationality, the others came with 13 different nationalities (discounting Doornbos racing under a Monaco license in 2005). Martini started in 103 Grands Prix for the team, while Morbidelli and Gen\u00e9 started 33 times.  Before Minardi's demise, the team was a particularly well-liked team within Formula One circles for its friendliness, accessibility, and lack of corporate culture.[2][3] On the track, their cars were regarded by many as well-designed for their tiny budget, their low position recognised as a result of a lack of funds (and engine power) rather than a poor car.[4] They also resisted employing pay-drivers more than most other financially strapped teams.  Former Minardi drivers include double World Champion Fernando Alonso, Grands Prix winners Alessandro Nannini, Giancarlo Fisichella, Jarno Trulli and Mark Webber; CART IndyCar World Series double champion Alessandro Zanardi and race winners Justin Wilson and Christian Fittipaldi; and 24 Hours of Le Mans overall winners Michele Alboreto and Marc Gen\u00e9. The Minardi family has a longstanding involvement in motorsport. Giancarlo Minardi's grandfather had a Fiat dealership in Faenza since 1927, while his father, Giovanni Minardi, competed in his own cars in the late 1940s. After his death, Giancarlo took over the racing part of the family business. He ran customer cars in Formula Two under the name Scuderia Everest from 1972 to 1979 and in 1976 briefly ran a customer Formula One Ferrari 312T with Giancarlo Martini, uncle of Pierluigi Martini. Martini Sr. qualified 15th for the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch but failed to start the race after an accident during the opening lap. The team then competed at the BRDC International Trophy in Silverstone where Martini finished 10th. In 1979 Minardi received financial backing from well known Italian motor racing patron Piero Mancini and set up the Minardi racing team as a Formula Two constructor.[5] The team first competed under the Minardi name in the 1980 European Formula Two championship. Rather than using a customer chassis, the team commissioned a BMW powered design from Giacomo Caliri's FLY studios \u2014 previously responsible for the Fittipaldi Automotive team's F5A Formula One car.[6] Minardi enjoyed four moderately successful Formula Two seasons with a variety of young Italian and South American drivers, including Alessandro Nannini and Johnny Cecotto. The team's most notable result was a 1981 win at the Misano round by Michele Alboreto.[5] Minardi left the lower division at the end of 1984, although in 1986 a modified version of their final Formula Two car, the 283, was entered without success in two rounds of the Formula 3000 championship which had replaced Formula Two in 1985.[7] During 1984, Minardi took the decision to enter Formula One the following year.[8] Caliri designed the M184, the team's prototype Formula One car (intended as a dual purpose design for the new Formula 3000) around Alfa Romeo's V8 turbocharged engine but when engineer Carlo Chiti left Alfa Romeo to found Motori Moderni, Minardi became the only customer for his new V6 engine design. The engine was not ready for the start of the 1985 season, so the team converted their M185 chassis to accept a Cosworth DFV engine for the first two races. The single car team was unsuccessful in its first year, scoring no points. The new engine was underpowered and driver Pierluigi Martini finished only two races, although he was also classified 11th at the German Grand Prix despite stopping with engine problems.[9] Martini's best position was 8th in the 1985 Australian Grand Prix, behind Huub Rothengatter in an Osella. Nonetheless, the team expanded to two cars for the 1986 season. In 1988 Minardi switched to Cosworth engines, and in 1989 it became top entrant for Pirelli's return to Formula One. The team was moderately successful in the midfield through the late 1980s and early 1990s, giving a succession of Italian drivers their first chance at the top level, including Alessandro Nannini, Pierluigi Martini and Gianni Morbidelli. Martini in particular was synonymous with Minardi, eventually having three spells with the team. He drove for them on their debut in 1985, scored their first point in the 1988 United States Grand Prix, although he had been running 5th for quite a long time during the race until being passed by Tyrrell's Jonathan Palmer, took their only front-row start at 1990 USA Grand Prix (aided by special Pirelli tyres; several of their other drivers had surprise qualifying results that day), their only lap leading a race in the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, where he finished 5th, and scored their joint-best F1 result up to that point (the other being at the British Grand Prix the same year).  In 1991 Minardi became the first team in modern times to make use of customer engines from Ferrari and in 1992 they used Lamborghini V12s. In 1993 Minardi enjoyed a good campaign, collecting seven points thanks to Christian Fittipaldi's fourth place in the 1993 South African Grand Prix and fifth place in the 1993 Monaco Grand Prix and Fabrizio Barbazza sixth places in the 1993 European Grand Prix and 1993 San Marino Grand Prix. As the number of small teams shrank, Minardi slipped from the mid-field towards the back of the grid. Money woes hit and in 1994 Minardi joined his team with BMS Scuderia Italia in an effort to survive. Giancarlo Minardi retained 14.5% with the remaining 85.5% distributed between the Scuderia Italia investors (Emilio Gnutti, Giuseppe Lucchini and Vittorio Palazzani) and Defendente Marniga. In 1994 Martini finished 5th at both the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix and 1994 French Grand Prix, while Michele Alboreto scored his last point in Formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. Acknowledging that the team was struggling, Bernie Ecclestone spoke to Flavio Briatore, who agreed to buy a share in the team in 1995. In 1996 Italian businessman Gabriele Rumi, former owner of the Fondmetal team switched his sponsorship support from Tyrrell to Minardi. He gradually increased his interest in the Faenza outfit, becoming co-owner and chairman. In 1997 Minardi teamed up with engine manufacturer Brian Hart. For the 2000 season the team were forced to use 1998-spec Ford Zetec-R V10 engines, which were rebadged as Fondmetal engines in deference to his financial input. However, Rumi's poor health forced him to withdraw his backing at the end of the season. Points were rare during this time; Pedro Lamy scored his one and only point in Formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1995 Australian Grand Prix; this result was followed by a long barren spell until Marc Gen\u00e9 finished 6th in the 1999 European Grand Prix. That same race, Luca Badoer had been running fourth until his gearbox failed with 13 laps to go, at which point the Italian burst into tears next to his stricken car. Other Minardi drivers also came close to scoring points, including Shinji Nakano who finished 7th at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix and Esteban Tuero, who finished 8th at the 1998 San Marino Grand Prix. Minardi was known for not using pay drivers, but for the 2000 season, the team signed Argentinian Gast\u00f3n Mazzacane, who only acquired the seat thanks to backing from the short-lived pay television channel Pan-American Sports Network. The team, now near collapse, was purchased by Australian businessman Paul Stoddart in early 2001, merging it with his European Racing Formula 3000 team. During this time Minardi gave Fernando Alonso his debut, despite being unable to score any points for Minardi he gave a good impression, subsequently he moved to Renault for the 2002 season.  Minardi's performance at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix ended up to be particularly successful, with Australian driver Mark Webber's bringing the car home in 5th place in his first Formula One race and Malaysian pay driver Alex Yoong finishing 7th. Another memorable episode happened during the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix. The race was stopped just after 75% distance, after treacherous weather and a sequence of accidents, including a spin into the grass for lead Minardi driver Jos Verstappen. Stoddart later claimed that Verstappen had enough fuel on board to last until just after the time the red flag was eventually waved, due to the large number of safety car laps. Assuming Stoddart is being truthful, Verstappen may well have won this race had he not spun. During its final years, the Minardi team was almost as famous for its politics as its racing. Stoddart was described as the Formula One teams' unofficial shop steward. During his time as team principal, Stoddart campaigned for reduced costs in the sport. He appealed to the competing car manufacturers for an agreement where the independent (and, on the whole, financially weaker) teams in Formula One would get cheaper engine deals than at present. In return, the team principals who would benefit from this would support the works teams when it came to opposing new rule changes enforced by the FIA, such as the proposed ban on traction control. Before the start of the 2004 season, however, Stoddart threatened to withdraw his support against the ban on traction control, but later changed his mind. Midway through the 2004 season, the other teams voted to change the unpopular single lap qualifying system back to the old 1 hour format, but Stoddart voted against because it would also mean the 107% rule being reintroduced; this meant the change never occurred, as a unanimous vote was required to change something so significant in the middle of a season. Before the 2005 Australian Grand Prix Stoddart initially threatened to withdraw his cars if they were made to comply with the revised regulations for 2005. Stoddart claimed that Minardi could not afford to adapt their cars. Once again Stoddart ended up withdrawing his threat. Stoddart has also repeatedly called for the resignation of the FIA's President, Max Mosley, particularly in the aftermath of the 2005 United States Grand Prix where the majority of teams withdrew from the race due to safety concerns about their Michelin tyres. While Minardi had run Bridgestone tyres, Stoddart had offered to compromise with the Michelin teams but Mosley had rejected it. In 2004 Minardi was represented by two rookies, Italian Gianmaria \"Gimmi\" Bruni and Hungarian Zsolt Baumgartner. During the year, they celebrated their 20th season in F1. Baumgartner scored Minardi's first point in more than 2 years at the United States Grand Prix, finishing 8th (only 8 cars finished the 2004 USGP). Baumgartner was also the first Hungarian to score a point in a World Championship F1 race. In 2005, Minardi's drivers were Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher. They amassed a total of 7 points following the debacle of the 2005 United States Grand Prix, in which they finished fifth and sixth (of six runners) respectively. After losing financial backing from his sponsors before the 2005 German Grand Prix, Patrick Friesacher was replaced by Dutch Jordan test driver Robert Doornbos, creating the first all-Dutch driver line-up in Formula one since Carel Godin de Beaufort and Ben Pon drove together for the Ecurie Maarsbergen team at the 1962 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. In 2005, Paul Stoddart stated that he would sell Minardi if he could find the right buyer. Stoddart claimed that he had 41 approaches.[10] His criterion for a sale was the ability of a buyer to move the team forward and leave the team based in Faenza. The drinks manufacturer Red Bull GmbH, which already owned another Formula One team, Red Bull Racing, decided to set up a second team to promote American drivers that had risen through its young driver programme, Red Bull Driver Search.[11] Ending several weeks of speculation on 10 September 2005 Red Bull announced it would take control of Minardi in November and run it as their \"rookie team\" from 2006.[12] Minardi fans worldwide immediately started an online petition[13] to save the Minardi team name and the team's 20-year heritage in F1 after the news broke. The petition was not successful and the team was renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2006 season. The greatly increased funding from Red Bull, including the use of the Red Bull chassis and Ferrari engines, gradually led to improved results, culminating in Toro Rosso's maiden win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. Giancarlo Minardi and Paul Stoddart have both made use of the Minardi name in new motorsport ventures. On 1 January 2006, Giancarlo Minardi re-acquired certain rights to use the Minardi name in racing. He also announced that he was licensing the Minardi name to established team GP Racing in the junior Euro Formula 3000 series, to be entitled 'Minardi Team by GP Racing'.[14] The team raced with moderate success, scoring a podium in each leg of the Spa round in June 2006.[15] For 2007, Minardi Team by GP Racing combined forces with GP2 team Piquet Sports, to form Minardi Piquet Sports.[16] For 2008 the team was known simply as Piquet Sports. In 2006, Paul Stoddart declared his intention to enter a new team called 'European Minardi F1 Team Ltd' into Formula One beginning in 2008. His application was unsuccessful, with the 12th place on the grid being awarded to Prodrive.[17] Instead, Stoddart turned his attentions to the U.S.-based Champ Car series. On 18 December 2006, it was confirmed that he had purchased a controlling interest in the CTE Racing-HVM Champ Car team and that the team would be renamed Minardi Team USA.[18] In 2007, the team had reasonable success. Robert Doornbos took two wins and several podium places on his way to third in the series, winning Rookie of the Year honours. When the series folded before its planned 2008 season, Stoddart's involvement ceased, with the team entering the IndyCar Series under the HVM name. Stoddart retains the right to use the Minardi name for a British-registered company. (key) ",

            "text": "  Missoni is a high-end Italian fashion house based in Varese, and known for its colorful knitwear designs. The company was founded by Ottavio (\"Tai\") and Rosita Missoni in 1953. The business was founded in 1953, when Ottavio and Rosita Missoni set up a small knitwear workshop in Gallarate, Italy.[1] They presented their first collection under the Missoni label in Milan in 1958.[1] The business prospered, with the support of fashion editor Anna Piaggi, then at Arianna magazine.[1] Rosita met the French stylist Emmanuelle Khanh in New York in 1965, which led to a collaboration and a new collection the following year.[1] In April 1967, they were invited to show at the Pitti Palace in Florence.[1] Rosita told the models to remove their bras, supposedly because they were the wrong color, and showed through the thin lam\u00e9 blouses. The material became transparent under the lights and caused a sensation.[1] The Missonis were not invited back the following year, but the business grew; a new factory in Sumirago was built in 1969.[1] Missoni designs were championed in the USA by Diana Vreeland, editor of American Vogue, and a Missoni boutique was opened in Bloomingdales.[1] Missoni reached the peak of its influence in the fashion world in the early 1970s (though has since been the subject of revivals in interest as new generations of fashion writers discovered the appeal of its core knitwear). Tai Missoni then became more interested in other projects, designing costumes for La Scala, carpets and tapestries. Rosita Missoni lost interest in fashion in the 1990s and was succeeded by her daughter Angela in 1998 while Rosita took over Missoni Home.[2] On 13 September 2011, Missoni made headlines briefly when Target Stores offered low-cost variants of Missoni products in their stores and on their website. Most items sold out within 24 hours, there were long queues outside stores and the Target website was overloaded. Some items appeared at higher prices on eBay within hours and Target did not restock.[3] In February 2014, Angela Missoni hired Rossella Jardini, former creative director of Moschino, as a consultant.[4] In 2017, Jennifer Lopez teamed up with Missoni along with Women\u2019s Cancer Research Fund and Saks Fifth Avenue to set a fund raise for cancer research. Lopez will help promote the $35 limited-edition Missoni tees, and the profits will go to 12 different cancer charities.[5] Missoni brands include Missoni Sport, which was initially licensed out, brought in-house in January 2002, and is now discontinued;[1] and M Missoni, a less expensive line introduced in 1998, manufactured and distributed by Marzotto.[1] Missoni Home has its roots in furnishing fabrics produced in 1981 in collaboration with Rosita's family firm.[1] They launched their first perfume in 1982,[1] although the license is now held by Est\u00e9e Lauder.[citation needed] In November 2005, Missoni and the Rezidor Hotel Group signed an agreement to create Hotel Missoni, with plans to have 30 hotels open or in development by 2012.[6] Their Edinburgh  hotel has been rebranded as Radisson Collection Edinburgh. The hotel agreement ceased in 2014.[7] In 2017, Missoni Baia, Missoni's first venture into residential real estate development, broke ground in Miami, Florida.  The 249 unit complex will be completed by the end of 2020.[8] In 1996 the Missonis transferred control of the business to their three children:[9] Vittorio Missoni became marketing director; Luca (born 1956) was menswear designer until 2008; Angela (born 1958) was womenswear designer, and took over menswear in 2008 when Luca became responsible for the Archive and Events.[10] Margherita Missoni used to both design accessories and model for Missoni as well. Today she runs her own line of children's clothing, which is not associated with Missoni SpA.[citation needed] On 4 January 2013 a plane carrying Vittorio Missoni, then CEO of Missoni, went missing off the coast of Venezuela.[11] On 27 June 2013, the Venezuelan government announced that remains of the aircraft had been found north of Los Roques archipelago.[12]  Vittorio's body was recovered along with those of the other passengers.

The first flight went from Rome to Lourdes on 27 August 2007 transporting the vicar of Rome, Cardinal Camillo Ruini.[5] In May 2018, owner Poste Italiane announced that Mistral Air will cease all scheduled and charter passenger flights to focus on cargo operations from now on. The airline has been loss-making for years and recently lost a PSO contract for Italian domestic services as well.[6][7] As of August 2018, Mistral Air no longer serves any scheduled routes. The remaining destinations served were Cagliari, Catania, Naples, Palermo, Perugia, Brescia and Pescara in Italy as well as Tirana in Albania which all ceased by August 2018.[8] Currently, there are also no more wetlease agreements or charter destinations Mistral air's international flight lands only in Tirana.

It is headed by Miuccia Prada and headquartered in Paris, France.[1] Miu Miu was established in 1993 by Miuccia Prada.[1] The name was conceived from Miuccia Prada's family nickname.[2] In 2011, Miu Miu launched the Women's Tales series. The campaign consisted of short films that were produced in conjunction with high-profile female directors. The outcome was a list of short, silent films that featured Miu Miu's collections. The first four short films were directed by Zoe Cassavetes, Lucrecia Martel, Giada Colagrande and Massy Tadjedin and were screened at the 69th Venice International Film Festival.[3] A fifth film that debut in 2013, was written and directed by Ava DuVernay and also starred.[4] On March 14, 2013, a counter report of Prada in violating women's rights was reported to Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[5][6] On May 17, 2013, a statement against sexual harassment and gender discrimination at workplace was released by the UN Committee.[7] In April 2013, an American Change.org petition against Miuccia Prada, collected over 200K signatures around the world. This petition was against Miuccia Prada for countersuing a fired employee for making false statements while voicing her opinion against sexual harassment. This petition damaged the brand image.[8] On May 28, 2013, The UN has backed former Prada employee Bovrisse over the sexual harassment and discrimination  case of Prada Japan.  Vogue launched a news article, \"Prada Vs The UN\" quoting Bovrisse claiming, \"Anyone who buys from the Prada and Miu Miu brands are supporting a culture of discrimination and power harassment.\"[9] Set to launch its first fragrance in 2015, Miu Miu's new venture is backed by the signed agreement between Coty Inc. and Prada. This is the first time that Miu Miu has expanded outside the fashion and accessories markets.[10] There are Miu Miu boutiques located on a global scale. Miu Miu opened its first independent store in China in the MIX in the city of Shenzhen in 2009.[11] A new North American store was launched in Houston, Texas, in The Galleria during the summer of 2011 and in Short Hills, New Jersey, in the fall of 2011. Miu Miu also opened their first Australian boutique at Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne.[12] A second opened at Westfield Sydney in 2011. A branch opened in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2010 and is situated in the Fraser's department store.[13] In 2017 the Miu Miu Sloane Street store in London reopened after a refurbishment, and announced that they would be starting a customisation service to allow customers to design their own heels. It's the only Miu Miu store in the world to offer this service.[14] Spokes-models for the brand have included Laetitia Casta, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Katie Holmes, Ginta Lapina, Lindsay Lohan, Vanessa Paradis, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Siri Tollerod, Lindsey Wixson, Zhou Xun, Jessica Stam and Joan Smalls.[15][16] In May 2011, Miu Miu appointed the (then only fourteen-year-old) actress Hailee Steinfeld to be the new younger face of the brand.[17][18] For the 2012 campaign, a 34-year-old, U.S. model Guinevere Van Seenus was chosen.[19] In 2018, actress Elle Fanning became the face of the brand. In 2019, Miu Miu appointed Irene Bae, leader of South Korean girl group Red Velvet, as the new face of the brand. ",

Mivar is the last Italian factory of televisions. Since the 80s until 2000 in Italy Mivar TVs have had a very wide spread, in fact these televisions were present in almost every Italian house, in the Italian TV studios, in schools, hospitals, hotels and prisons, because these CRT TVs were good, cheap, robust and durable. When the market decided to focus on the LCD TVs, Mivar was unprepared and had serious difficulties. But thanks to the tenacity of the master Carlo Vichi, Mivar introduced between 2004 and 2010 some new attractive and competitive LCD-CCFL TVs, and in 2011 some new LED TVs. The televisions made today by Mivar are also particularly simple and rational, with a particular Italian design and front speakers for better sound. Today's Mivar TVs are all made in Italy. Since 2013 the production of the factory is only oriented tables and chairs. At same time, the property has declared its willingness to grant the free usufruct of its new plant (except ordinary expense management) to anyone who wants to produce: TVs, high tech products, household appliances or electronic equipment.

The company was founded in 1959 under the name Navigazione Arcipelago Maddalenino (NAVARMA for short). In 2006 Moby Lines purchased Lloyd Sardegna. The company is known for using Warner Bros. Looney Tunes characters as the external livery of its ships. NAVARMA was founded in 1959 by Achille Onorato, and started traffic from Sardinia to the islands on coast of Sardinia with the small ferry M/S Maria Maddalena purchased from Denmark. In February 1966 NAVARMA purchased a second ferry, M/S Bonaficio, and started  service between Sardinia and Corsica.  The company slowly expanded, purchasing another ferry in 1967 and taking delivery of two newbuilds in 1974 and 1981. With the larger fleet, new routes to the Italian mainland were also introduced. In 1982 the company acquired M/S Free Enterprise II from Townsend Thoresen, renamed her M/S Moby Blu and painted her in the \"blue whale\" livery that later came to characterise Moby Lines (the company name still remained NAVARMA at this point). The Moby Blu was over twice the size of NAVARMA's previously largest ship. By 1988 four additional larger ferries (all with Moby-prefixed names) had joined by NAVARMA fleet and additional routes to the Italian mainland were opened. In 1991 one of the ferries of the fleet, the Moby Prince, was involved in the worst disaster in the Italian merchant navy since World War II. During the early 1990s NAVARMA acquired further used ferries, which replaced the Moby ferries acquired in the 1980s. During the same time \"Moby Lines\" was adopted as the official company name. From 1996 onwards the company fleet has grown radically with addition of new, larger and faster tonnage, including the newbuilt fast cruiseferries Moby Wonder, Moby Freedom and Moby Aki. Around 2003 Moby Lines entered an agreement with Warner Bros. to paint their vessels in liveries featuring Looney Tunes characters. However, only the larger ships have such liveries, the company's smaller ships either have similar graphics not featuring the Looney Tunes characters, or simply the Moby Lines' whale logo. ",

MOMO was founded by gentleman racer Gianpiero Moretti in 1964.[1] MOMO are the initials for Moretti-Monza. Monza is a town in the Province of Milan. That year, Moretti produced a racing steering wheel for his own race car. This was the first steering wheel produced by the brand. Compared to the other racing steering wheels available on the market at that time, Momo featured thicker grip, the other racers noticed the convenience of that steering wheel and wanted to obtain the same for their vehicles. So, steering wheels by this brand gained fame throughout the racing community and among the Formula One drivers. So, John Surtees, one of Formula One\u2019s drivers, requested the same steering wheel for his single-seater Ferrari. That same year, he won a Formula One race - the first significant victory of the Momo brand. In 1969 MOMO opened production plant in Tregnago, Province of Verona.[1] Due to increasing United States federal government safety regulations and the wide adoption of airbags in passenger vehicles internationally, MOMO was sold in 1996 to Breed Technologies, a steering wheel airbag manufacturer. Breed Technologies was acquired by private equity firm Carlyle Group and merged with other OEM automotive businesses they owned to form Key Safety Systems in 2003. Key Safety Systems sold the MOMO brand name to an Italian private equity group in 2006, but most of the manufacturing plants and technologies previously owned by MOMO were retained by Key Safety Systems. In 2011, MOMO was sold to Henrique Cisneros, a Venezuelan-American businessman part of the Grupo Cisneros and amateur racecar driver.[2][3] MOMO's product range includes consumer accessories such as steering wheels, shift knobs and alloy wheels, through to race equipment such as racing suits and helmets. MOMO airbagged steering wheels have become standard accessories on some regional Subaru and Mitsubishi performance cars. MOMO steering wheels were standard features in the UMM Alter II from 1987 to 1991. MOMO has also designed a steering wheel for computer peripheral company Logitech (called the Logitech MOMO), to be used as a video game controller. Thomas Superwheel controllers (a brand of high-quality, premium priced controllers) also feature the MOMO name. Also watches, eyewear, fragrances, clothing, accessories, etc. are made by brand MOMO DESIGN.[4] The company sponsored many prototype cars in the IMSA WSC series including the Ferrari 333 SP sports prototype car, after Scuderia Ferrari had retired from that racing category 20 years earlier. MOMO was the official steering wheel of the Champ Car series from 2004 to 2007, before Champ Car merged to Indy Racing League. MOMO are also suppliers of the official steering wheel, racing seats, clothing and racing accessories of the Speedcar Series. MOMO also sponsors Lira Motorsports in the ARCA Racing Series and the Camping World Truck Series. ",

            "text": " FB Mondial[1] is a motorcycle manufacturer, founded in 1929, in Milan, Italy. They are best known for their domination of Motorcycle World Championships between 1949 and 1957. The firm produced some of the most advanced and successful Grand Prix road racers of the time, winning five rider and five manufacturer World Championships in that short period. FB Mondial was born under the impulse of the Boselli brothers Luigi, Carlo, Ettore and Ada. FB stands for \"Fratelli Boselli\" (English: Boselli Brothers). Father of the entrepreneurial brothers was Giuseppe Boselli, a well-respected pilot and co-owner of GD, a legendary motorcycle company from Bologna. Initially, a workshop was opened for sales and service of G.D models, but within a few months, it soon became clear that there was a market demand for a cheap and robust motorbike. During his years as a competitive motorcyclist, Count Giuseppe Boselli had met Oreste Drusiani, a well-known engine builder and the pair struck a deal. It was in Oreste's farm in Bologna that FB established its first production site, dedicating itself to the construction of motorbikes. After steady success in their early years, in 1943 FB decided to expand their production capability and buy modern machinery to increase production. Unfortunately they could not put their plan into practice, as on 24 July 1943, a heavy allied bombing struck the Bologna railway station and its surroundings, shaking the farm. The machinery survived, but was commandeered by the military to aid in the war effort, putting production on hold for the duration of the war. The collaboration between the Drusiani family and the Boselli family continued at the end of the war period, with the reconstruction of the building, thanks to the enormous economic resources of Boselli, who took over full control of the company.[2][3] FB effectively relaunched in 1948 as FB Mondial. Mondial found early racing success, winning their first of what would become five World Championships in only their second year of production. During a time when MV Agusta and Ducati produced economy lightweight two-stroke motorcycles, mopeds and scooters, Mondial was more of a \"boutique\" manufacturer, specializing in high-performance, small-displacement motorcycles.  Much of the production of each motorcycle was done by hand, which kept output low, with production numbers typically ranging between 1,000 and 2,000 units per year. Mondial were able to continue this success for a number of years, sticking with this methodology. In 1957, Soichiro Honda approached Mondial owner Count Boselli for purchase of a Mondial racebike, with which the firm had just won the 125\u00a0cc and 250\u00a0cc world titles. Count Boselli gave Mr. Honda a racing Mondial; Honda used this bike as a standard to which he aspired, in order to compete on a world-scale. An original Mondial 125\u00a0cc racebike is, still now, the first bike on display when entering Honda's Motegi Collection Hall.  After the 1957 Grand Prix season, many major Italian motorcycle manufacturers including Gilera, Moto Guzzi, and MV Agusta announced that they would pull out of Grand Prix competition citing increasing costs and diminishing sales (MV Agusta later reconsidered and continued racing).[1][4] Mondial, despite their continued success, decide to join them. This marked the beginning of a decline in popularity and sales for the Italian company, and in 1960, the last all-Mondial motorcycle left the factory.  After this, Mondial continued for a while, purchasing engines from proprietary makers.  In this hybrid form, motorcycles with Mondial frames and ancillary parts, but non-Mondial engines, were produced by the factory for the next 19 years. However, Mondial stopped production in their entirety in 1979, until their rebirth nearly twenty years later.  In 1999, the rights to Mondial were purchased by newspaper tycoon Roberto Ziletti. Ziletti was an avid motorcyclist in his youth, and his dream was to own a prestigious motorcycle company. Soon after purchasing the rights, Ziletti's father died, leaving him in charge of the Lastra Group. Mondial started producing superbikes again soon afterward. In 2000 Ziletti asked Honda to supply engines for the new Mondial (the Piega 1000) from their race-winning RC51 superbikes. A deal was supposedly made because Mondial had supplied Soichiro Honda with that 1957 racebike. This was the first time Honda has ever allowed a firm to use its engines for their production vehicles.[citation needed] Mondial's difficulties occurred when Lastra acquired Mitsubishi Corp.'s worldwide graphic arts division, leaving Roberto Ziletti insufficient time to focus on Mondial. He had spent more than 11 million Euros on the company, and after failing to farm Mondial out to a Swiss company, the Arcore factory was placed in the hands of the Monza bankruptcy court in July 2004, with around 35 Mondial Piega 1000s in various states of completion. To place this in perspective, Lastra Group had a turnover exceeding 500 million Euros in 2004. In interviews in March 2005 a south Georgia motorcycle dealership, stated that the courts had arranged to sell Mondial to their American firm, Superbike Racing, on 28 February 2005, and that they would continue the marque.[5] However, the Monza courts sold Mondial Moto SPA to another buyer on 27 July 2005: Biemme, another motorcycle firm located in Meda (near Milan) and owned by Piero Caronni (the same man who bought from Rimini bankruptcy court the remains and the production right from Bimota for the then defunct Bimota V Due), renamed itself as GRUPPO MONDIAL S.R.L. and continues offering the Piega 1000s to the market. In 2014, friends Count Pierluigi Boselli, owner of the Mondial brand and descendant of the original founders, and Cesare Galli, holder of Pelpi international Italy, started to lay the foundation of a project to revive the company, sketching out the first designs that would in time become the first motorcycle. Cesare Galli was formerly the Technical Director at Fantic Motor, the successful Italian offroad brand. Galli worked there until Fantic shut down in 1996 (it has since been restarted successfully), after winning a hat-trick of World Trials Championships with his designs, as well as successive World and Italian Enduro titles. Galli took over the importation of Kawasaki dirtbikes and ATVs for Italy. In 2002 he founded Pelpi International, European distributor for Taiwanese scooter and minibike manufacturers Aeon and Over.[6] Through that first year and all of 2015 the initial design sketches evolved into prototypes then eventually became reality; the HPS 125 and HPS 250 for FB Mondial. The HPS design aims to be a fusion of the classic F.B. Mondial character, with modern technology.[7] Built by Piaggio in China, who also produce vehicles for iconic Italian brands such as Aprilia and Vespa, the new Mondials are effectively Piaggio engines with Mondial's own higher specification design of chassis and styling.[8] The firm currently offers four variants to the market. The traditionally styled 'caf\u00e9-racer' HPS, available with a 125cc and 250cc engine, as well as the off-road, sportier styled SMT and SMX models.[7] World Championship 1949 \t World Championship 1950  World Championship 1951 World Championship 1957 After the 1957 Grand Prix season, the major Italian motorcycle manufacturers including Gilera, Moto Guzzi, MV Agusta and Mondial announced that they would pull out of Grand Prix competition citing increasing costs and diminishing sales.[4] 1951 Isle of Man TT 1957 Isle of Man TT ",

            "text": "Morbidelli was an Italian motorcycle manufacturer founded by Giancarlo Morbidelli in Pesaro. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company was particularly successful in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. The team won the 125\u00a0cc world championship in 1975, 1976 and 1977, and won the 250\u00a0cc championship in 1977.[1] The firm began as a woodworking shop building furniture and wooden coach bodies for automobiles. Morbidelli's business grew to have 300 employees, however his greater passion lay in motorcycles and motorcycle racing. He used the woodworking business to finance his racing interests.[2] In 1969, he entered a team in the Grand Prix motorcycle racing Italian championships with a 50\u00a0cc machine. In 1971, he also commissioned the construction of a water-cooled disc valve 125\u00a0cc two-stroke of Ringhini design, inspired by the engine of an ex-works Suzuki 125cc.[3] The team won two 125\u00a0cc Grand Prix races with Italian rider Gilberto Parlotti at the beginning of the 1972 season but tragedy struck when Parlotti was killed during the Isle of Man TT race. Despite Parlotti's death, Morbidelli persevered with his racing effort. Starting in 1974 Jorg Muller, previously the designer for Van Veen Kreidler, took over development.[3] In 1975, he was rewarded with his first World Championship when Paolo Pileri won the 125\u00a0cc crown.[4] His Morbidelli teammate, Pier Paolo Bianchi finished in second. Bianchi won the 125\u00a0cc championship a year later.[5] The 1977 Grand Prix season would mark the height of Morbidelli's accomplishments when the team won both the 125 and 250 classes. Mario Lega won the 250 crown and Pier Paolo Bianchi would take the 125 honors.[6] Up until 1976 Morbidellis were not available for sale to private racers - only the team's own works riders could race on them. A new factory was built with help from Benelli Armi in Pesaro, called the MBA factory (Morbidelli-Benelli-Armi), to produce Morbidelli motorcycles of 123\u00a0cc and 248\u00a0cc in quantity.[3]  These were raced successfully for several more years.[2] The MBA team won the 125\u00a0cc World Championship in year 1978 with Eugenio Lazzarini and in 1980 with Pier Paolo Bianchi. Morbidelli continued in Grand Prix competition until the 1982 season. Giancarlo Morbidelli's son, Gianni Morbidelli became a successful racecar driver, reaching Formula One where he achieved a podium finish. In 1994, Morbidelli constructed an innovative shaft-drive, five-speed, 32-valve, liquid-cooled, 847\u00a0cc, 90\u00b0 V8, sport touring motorcycle, but its high price meant it would not be economically feasible to produce.  The Guinness Book of World Records listed it in 2001 as the world's most expensive motorcycle.[7]  Because of the bike's exotic design, it was displayed in The Art of the Motorcycle at the Guggenheim Museums in New York, Bilbao and Las Vegas. An example can also be seen at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum in Birmingham, Alabama, USA.  Another V8 is on display at the Morbidelli Museo in Pesaro, Italy. The story of the Morbidelli racing team is told in the documentary film \"Morbidelli - a story of men and fast motorcycles\" (2014), by directors Jeffrey Zani and Matthew Gonzales.[8] The documentary features footage from the 1972 Tourist Trophy, the 1976 and 1977 racing seasons, races in the city of Pesaro in the 1950s, and more. It also features interviews with riders Eugenio Lazzarini, Alberto Ieva, Pier Paolo Bianchi, Mario Lega and Graziano Rossi. Today the former Morbidelli factory in Pesaro houses a classic motorcycle museum that reminds visitors of the company's former glory. The complete world championship story is represented among the exhibits as well as many antique motorcycles. ",

            "text": "Moretti S.p.A. is a former Italian automobile manufacturer. It was founded in 1925 and ceased automobile production in December 1989. Today, many of its sports car models can still be found at various European auto shows. Moretti Motors produced a variety of models at various times including motorcycles, microcars, and several commercial vehicles. Moretti Motor Company was founded in 1925 by Giovanni Moretti in order to design and build motorcycles, both of his own design and with agreements with other companies. Using the same motorcycle engines, Giovanni Moretti also dabbled in microcars in the late 1920s and early 1930s. During World War II, Moretti found success constructing various commercial vehicles, most notably a range of electric powered small trucks and a 5- or 7-seat electric car. In 1946, with the war over and thus demand for their commercial vehicles wavering, Moretti began production of conventional cars. The first conventional car model released by Moretti Motors was the 'Cita'. Shortly afterwards Moretti came out with the '600'.  Then, in 1953, the '750' was released. Various versions of the '750' were built during the 1950s including estates, taxis, berlinas, coupes, single seat racing cars and commercial vehicles. Some competitive success was achieved in the 1950s with the 600 and 750 models. A major shift in Moretti Motors' operations came in the latter part of the 1950s when they ceased designing and building complete cars. In an effort to reduce costs and overhead, the company switched to using Fiat mechanicals and chassis for all of its conventional automobiles. Despite offering a full range of model versions based on the '750' (saloon, coup\u00e9, spider, estate and more) though, Moretti was still unable to compete with Fiat's 600, which cost almost half the price and consequently dominated much of the marketplace. Mass production of all models were subsequently slashed due to continued low sales and financial struggles. However, thanks to the friendship between Giovanni Moretti and Gianni Agnelli, Moretti Motors was able to strike a favorable agreement with Fiat to continue using Fiat chassis for a series of special/low volume models. Sporty-looking coup\u00e9s with very similar bodywork utilizing 127, 128, 124, and 132 underpinnings were built in the late sixties and early seventies. In 1967 Moretti produced only 2,600 cars, in 1973 only 3,292 were produced, and by 1974 production was down to only 1,071. In the seventies, Moretti switched to building mini-offroaders and beach cars on Fiat-basis. The Fiat 500-based \"Minimaxi\" first appeared in 1970, and was later adapted to take 126 underpinnings. The 127-based \"Midimaxi\" appeared in 1971.[1] There was also a stretched pickup and van on 127-basis, called the \"Paguro\", which arrived 1977. In 1979 the Fiat Campagnola-based Moretti Sporting appeared, with a 2.5 liter diesel engine.[2] The very luxurious \"127 Vip\" and \"Ritmo Gold\" arrived in 1980. The Panda Rock, which was presented in 1983, was a roofless and rollbar-equipped Panda 4x4 intended for off-roading purposes. A \"Midimaxi III serie\" was also presented in 1983, based on the most recent version of the 127.[1] In a continuing effort to occupy ever narrower niches left vacant by Fiat themselves, Moretti also offered panel van (\"Furgonetta\") versions of the Uno and Panda 4x4.[3] Later, as production continued to fall, Moretti turned to producing personalised conversions of various Fiats such as the Uno, Panda and Regata. At the 1983 Bologna Motor Show a \"cabriolet\" version of the Fiat Uno was presented. It was actually a cabrio coach rather than a full convertible, retaining the door rails and rear side windows. Equipped with series engines (including a diesel option), it was sold directly through select Fiat dealers in Italy.[1] In 1989 Moretti produced the \"Ital Uno Turbo[4]\" which was imported in limited numbers to USA by M.I.K Automotive in North Hollywood, California. The car was based on the Fiat Uno Turbo with a 1.3 L turbo engine and with anti-skid braking system, the car was also fitted with TOYO 13\" tires. Finally, after several years of decline, in December 1989 the Moretti Motor Company officially ceased operations.[5] Moretti showed an estate version of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta in 1978. The conversion had a tailgate which reached all the way down to the bumper, even though it retained the original rear doors as well as taillights.[6]  ",

It was founded in 1983 by Franco Moschino. The brand was originally created in 1983 by the late Franco Moschino (1950\u20131994). Moschino and his fashion label became famous for his innovative, colorful\u00a0\u2013 sometimes eccentric\u00a0\u2013 designs, for his love of fairies, for his criticisms of the fashion industry and for his social awareness campaigns in the early 1990s.[1][2] After Moschino's death, Rossella Jardini, his former assistant, became creative director.[3][4] The brand has been part of the Aeffe fashion group since 1999. Rossella Jardini was Moschino\u2019s Creative Director from 1994 to October 2013.[5] Responsible for the brand image and style, Jardini fulfilled the role of \u201ccreative witness\u201d, keeping the stylistic and philosophical approach alive following the death of Franco Moschino (on 18 September 1994), with whom she collaborated from 1981.[citation needed] In October 2013, Jeremy Scott became Moschino's creative director, showing his first Moschino collection in Fall 2014.[5] In 2006, Moschino designed the outfits for the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.[6] Moschino also designed outfits for Kylie Minogue's 2005 Showgirl - The Greatest Hits Tour,[7] sunglasses for Madonna's 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour[8][9] and six outfits for Lady Gaga for her The Born This Way Ball in 2011-2012. Starting with the F/W 2008-2009 pre-collection, the Moschino Jeans label changed its name to Love Moschino.[citation needed] The owner of the Moschino labels is Moschino SpA, the company which was acquired by Aeffe SpA (producer of Moschino since 1983) and Sportswear International SpA (SINV HOLDING S.p.A. since 2006) in 1999. Moschino SpA carries out its brand management, licensing agreement activities, communication and coordination of the commercial policies autonomously. In 2007, Moschino SpA signed an exclusive agreement with con Scienward International Holdings Limited for the franchising and distribution of its products in the People\u2019s Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau). The ten-year agreement provides for the opening of forty stores (22 in the first five years of collaboration) and the exclusive distribution of Moschino brand clothing lines beginning with the S/S 2008 collection. Moschino SpA also announced its five-year renewable agreement with Allison for the creation, development and worldwide distribution of the new Moschino Eyewear collection, and the signing of a five-year agreement (renewable for another five years) with the Binda Group for the manufacture and marketing of watches and for the very first time of the jewellery collection licensed with the Moschino CheapAndChic brand. The new collection of Moschino Helmets was presented to the world for the first time in November 2007, during the EICMA show. These helmets were the result of a  collaboration between Max Safety Fashion helmet manufacturers and the Moschino fashion brand. In October 2008, Moschino SpA and Altana SpA, leading companies in the children\u2019s clothing sector, announced the signing of an agreement for the creation, development and world distribution, for five years renewable, of the Moschino boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 collections. The collections, whose creative aspect remains at Moschino, were aimed at three age groups: Moschino Teen for ages six through fourteen; Moschino Kid for twelve\u2013eighteen months to six years; and Moschino Baby from one\u2013three months to two years. In July 2011, the company collection was presented at the catwalk of The Brandery fashion show in Barcelona.[10] In February 2014, WWD announced that Angela Missoni hired Rossella Jardini, who is the former creative director of Moschino, as a consultant, \"\"to exchange ideas\" on her fashion collections\".[11] Angela Missoni will continue to be creative director of Missoni.[11] The brand consists of several labels: Moschino (women's and men's main line), Moschino Cheap and Chic (women's secondary line, created in 1988), Love Moschino (women's and men's  diffusion line, known as Moschino Jeans from 1986 to 2008), in order of exclusivity. In addition, accessories, jewelry, watches, perfume and cosmetics, and even jet helmets[12] are sold under the Moschino brand. Almost all models of watches are made by Binda Group. In Milan, Moschino opened its own concept hotel in 2009, \"Maison Moschino\".[13] Starting 2014 and under the direction of creative director Jeremy Scott, Moschino Cheap and Chic was consolidated into a new women's secondary line called Boutique Moschino. In April 2018, Moschino announced its collaboration with the Swedish retail brand H&M which was planned to be launched in November 2018.[14] In April 2019, it was announced that Moschino would release a collection in collaboration with EA game The Sims 4. The collection will include pixelated clothing inspired by the game.[15] ",

After brazing, each frame is hand filed and aligned on a digital alignment table. The smooth lines resulting from the lack of lugs are emphasized with a unicrown fork and an integrated seatpost, attached by an expander bolt in a manner similar to the handlebar stem.  ",

            "text": " Moto Guzzi is an Italian motorcycle manufacturer and the oldest European manufacturer in continuous motorcycle production.[1][2][3] Established in 1921 in Mandello del Lario, Italy, the company is noted for its historic role in Italy's motorcycling manufacture, its prominence worldwide in motorcycle racing, and industry innovations\u2014including the first motorcycle centre stand, wind tunnel and eight-cylinder engine.[4] Since 2004, Moto Guzzi has been an unico azionista, a wholly owned subsidiary, and one of seven brands owned by Piaggio & C. SpA,[5][6] Europe's largest motorcycle manufacturer and the world's fourth largest motorcycle manufacturer by unit sales.[6] The company's motorcycles are noted for their air-cooled 90\u00b0 V-twin engines with a longitudinal crankshaft orientation where the engines' transverse cylinder heads project prominently on either side of the motorcycle.[7][8] Similar to other storied motorcycle manufacturers that have survived for decades, Moto Guzzi has experienced a series of business cycles and a series of ownership arrangements\u2014some complex, some brief, some that have endured. Moto Guzzi was conceived by two aircraft pilots and their mechanic serving in the Corpo Aeronautico Militare (the Italian Air Corp, CAM) during World War I: Carlo Guzzi, Giovanni Ravelli and Giorgio Parodi. Assigned to the same Miraglia Squadron based outside Venice,[9] the three became close, despite coming from different socio-economic backgrounds. The trio envisioned creating a motorcycle company after the war. Guzzi would engineer the motor bikes, Parodi (the son of wealthy Genovese ship-owners) would finance the venture, and Ravelli (already a famous pilot and motorcycle racer) would promote the bikes with his racing prowess. Guzzi and Parodi (along with Parodi's brother) formed Moto Guzzi in 1921. Ravelli, ironically, had died just days after the war's end in an aircraft crash and is commemorated by the eagle's wings that form the Moto Guzzi logo.[10] Carlo Guzzi and Giorgio Parodi, along with Giorgio's brother Angelo, created a privately held silent partnership \"Societ\u00e0 Anonima Moto Guzzi\" on 15 March 1921, for the purpose of (according to the original articles of incorporation) \"the manufacture and the sale of motor cycles and any other activity in relation to or connected to metallurgical and mechanical industry\". The company was legally based in Genoa, Italy, with its headquarters in Mandello. The very earliest motorcycles bore the name G.P. (Guzzi-Parodi), though the marque quickly changed to Moto Guzzi. As the only actual shareholders, the Parodi's wanted to shield their shipping fortunes by avoiding confusion of name G.P. with Giorgio Parodi's initials. Carlo Guzzi initially received royalties for each motorcycle produced, holding no ownership in the company that bore his name. In 1946 Moto Guzzi formally incorporated as Moto Guzzi S.p.A. with Giorgio Parodi as chairman. Carlo Guzzi's first engine design was a horizontal single-cylinder engine that dominated the first 45 years of the company's history in various configurations. Through 1934, each engine bore the signature of the mechanic who built it. As originally envisioned, the company used racing to promote the brand. In the 1935 Isle of Man TT, Moto Guzzi factory rider Stanley Woods performed an impressive double victory with wins in the Lightweight TT as well as the Senior TT. Until the mid-1940s, the traditional horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500\u00a0cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but contrary to the usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs. In the 1950s, Moto Guzzi, along with the Italian factories of Gilera and Mondial, led the world of Grand Prix motorcycle racing. With durable and lightweight 250\u00a0cc and 350\u00a0cc bikes designed by Giulio Carcano, the firm dominated the middleweight classes. The factory won five consecutive 350\u00a0cc world championships between 1953 and 1957. In realizing that low weight alone might not continue to win races for the company, Carcano designed the V8 500\u00a0cc GP race bike\u2014whose engine was to become one of the most complex engines of its time. Despite the bike's having led many races and frequently posted the fastest lap time, it often failed to complete races because of mechanical problems. Ultimately, the V8 was not developed further as Moto Guzzi withdrew (together with the main competitors Gilera and Mondial) from racing after the 1957 season citing escalating costs and diminishing motorcycle sales. By the time of its pull out from Grand Prix racing, Moto Guzzi had won 3,329 official races, 8 World Championships, 6 Constructor's Championships and 11 Isle of Man TT victories. The period after World War II was as difficult in Mandello del Lario as it was elsewhere in post-war Europe. The solution was production of inexpensive, lighter cycles. The 1946 \"Motoleggera\", a 65\u00a0cc lightweight motorcycle became very popular in post-war Italy. A four-stroke 175\u00a0cc scooter known as the \"Galletto\" also sold well. Though modest cycles for the company, the lighter cycles continue to feature Guzzi's innovation and commitment to quality. The step-through Galletto initially featured a manual, foot-shifted three-speed (160\u00a0cc) configuration then later a four-speed (175\u00a0cc) set-up by the end of 1952. The displacement was increased to 192\u00a0cc in 1954 and electric start was added in 1961. Moto Guzzi was limited in its endeavors to penetrate the important scooter market as motorcycle popularity waned after WWII. Italian scooter competitors would not tolerate an incursion from Moto Guzzi. By innovating the first large-wheeled scooter, Guzzi competed less directly with manufacturers of small-wheeled scooters such as Piaggio (Vespa) and Lambretta. To illustrate the delicate balance within the Italian post-war motorcycle and scooter markets, when Guzzi developed their own prototype for a small-wheeled scooter, Lambretta retaliated with a prototype for a small V-twin motorcycle threatening to directly compete on Moto Guzzi's turf. The two companies compromised: Guzzi never produced their small-wheeled scooter and Lambretta never manufactured the motorcycle. The drive train that Lambretta made in their 1953 motorcycle prototype remarkably resembles the V-twin + drive shaft arrangement that Guzzi developed more than ten years later, ultimately to become iconic of the company. By 1964, the company was in full financial crisis. Emanuele Parodi and his son Giorgio had died, Carlo Guzzi had retired to private life, and direction passed to Enrico Parodi, Giorgio's brother. Carlo Guzzi died on 3 November 1964, in Mandello, after a brief hospital stay in Davos.[9] In February 1967, SEIMM (Societ\u00e0 Esercizio Industrie Moto Meccaniche), a state controlled receiver, took ownership of Moto Guzzi. The SEIMM oversight saw Moto Guzzi adapting to a cultural shift away from motorcycles to automobiles. The company focused on popular lightweight mopeds including the Dingo and Trotter \u2013 and the 125\u00a0cc Stornello motorcycle. Also during the SEIMM years Guzzi developed the 90\u00b0 V twin engine, designed by Giulio Cesare Carcano, which would become iconic of Moto Guzzi. Though Moto Guzzi has employed engines of myriad configurations, none has come to symbolize the company more than the air-cooled 90\u00b0 V-twin with a longitudinal crankshaft orientation and the engine's transverse cylinder heads projecting prominently on either side of the bike. The original V-twin was designed in the early 1960s by engineer Giulio Cesare Carcano, designer of the DOHC V8 Grand Prix racer. The air-cooled, longitudinal crankshaft, transverse cylinder, pushrod V-twin began life with 700\u00a0cc displacement and 45\u00a0hp (34\u00a0kW) \u2013 designed to win a competition sponsored by the Italian government for a new police bike. The sturdy shaft-drive, air-cooled V-twin won, giving Moto Guzzi renewed competitiveness. This 1967 Moto Guzzi V7 with the original Carcano engine has been continuously developed into the 1,200\u00a0cc, 80\u00a0hp (60\u00a0kW) versions offered today (2006). Lino Tonti redesigned the motor for the 1971 Moto Guzzi V7 Sport. This engine is the basis of the currently used 750\u00a0cc, 1,100\u00a0cc and 1,200\u00a0cc Guzzi engines. The longitudinal crankshaft and orientation of the engine creates a slight gyroscope effect, with a slightly asymmetrical behavior in turns. After experiencing financial difficulties in the late 1960s, De Tomaso Industries Inc. (D.T.I. Group or DTI), manufacturer of the De Tomaso sports and luxury cars, owned by Argentinian industrialist Alejandro de Tomaso, purchased SEIMM (and thereby Moto Guzzi) along with Benelli and Maserati in 1973. Under Tomaso's stewardship, Moto Guzzi returned to profitability,[11] though other reports suggest a period of limited investment in Moto Guzzi followed attributed to DTI using Moto Guzzi financially prioritizing their automotive ventures.[12] In 1976, Guzzi released the 850 Le Mans, a cafe racer that was a stylistic masterpiece and still today considered one of the most iconic and sought-after of all Guzzis.[according to whom?] A marketing success that would compete with other Italian superbikes, it spawned four later models from Mark II to its culmination in the 1990s, the Mark V. The initial model is known widely but incorrectly as the Mark I. Technically, it is simply the 850 Le Mans. It was named in homage to the 24-hour endurance race and circuit in France. The Mark I had two production runs with slight modifications. The first run, known as Series 1, used the roundish CEV stop/taillight used on many Italian bikes of the decade. Fewer than 2,000 of the round taillight bikes were made and they are the most desirable Guzzi of the era.[citation needed] The second production run, known as the Series 2 and totaling around 4,000 bikes, used a De Tomaso-designed rectangular taillight/reflector and modified rear guard. This was also used on the Mark II and SP models. The taillight and guard was the biggest change between Series 1 and 2 but other modifications included later inclusion of a tripmeter, black fork lowers, a more generous dual seat that replaced the split-prone original seat, exhaust pipe heel guards and inferior fuel taps. The extra cost compared to the \"cooking\" T3 model paid for performance items such as high-compression domed pistons, larger inlet and exhaust valves and Dell'Orto 36\u00a0mm pumper carbs with filterless grey plastic velocity stacks. Most Mk I bikes were brilliant red although a very small number were painted in metallic ice blue. An exceedingly small number[clarification needed] of Series 2 bikes were white. In 1979, a small-block version of the air-cooled V-twin designed by engineer Lino Tonti was introduced as the V35. Radical when introduced, the design featured horizontally split crankcases and Heron heads. The former was a common feature of contemporary Japanese motorcycle design, whilst the latter was widely used in car engines. Both features allow more efficient mass production and also the design of the engine and associated components cut the weight from 548\u00a0lb (249\u00a0kg) of the contemporary 850 T3 to the 385\u00a0lb (175\u00a0kg) of the V35. The power of the original V35 at 35\u00a0bhp (26\u00a0kW) was competitive with engines of comparable displacement of the period \u2013 later, larger versions (V50, V65, V75) were rapidly outclassed by competing water-cooled engines. The Breva and Nevada today feature a descendant of Tonti's V35 engine: the 750\u00a0cc V-twin, rated at 48\u00a0bhp (36\u00a0kW).  With its ease of maintenance, durability and even, flat torque curve, the engine design remains suitable to everyday, real-world situations. As Guzzi continued to develop the V-twin, power was increased in the mid-1980s when Guzzi created four-valve versions of the \"small block\" series. Of these, the 650 and the 750 were rated at 60\u00a0bhp (45\u00a0kW) and 65\u00a0bhp (48\u00a0kW) respectively. The production of the four-valve \"small block\" engines ended in the later 1980s. Moto Guzzis have used an hydraulic integrated brake system, where the right front disc works off the handlebar lever, while the left front and the rear disc work off the foot brake. The cartridge front fork used in Guzzi's motorcycles of the later 1970s and 1980s is a Guzzi invention. Instead of containing the damping oil in the fork, it is in a cartridge. Oil in the fork is purely for lubrication. Still under the De Tomaso umbrella, in 1988, Benelli and SEIMM merged to create Guzzi Benelli Moto (G.B.M. S.p.A.). During this period, Moto Guzzi existed as an entity within the De Tomaso owned G.B.M., but in 1996 celebrated its 75th birthday and the return of its name to Moto Guzzi S.p.A.  In 1996, De Tomaso became Trident Rowan Group, also known as TRG. Under the helm of Ivano Beggio, Aprilia S.p.A acquired Moto Guzzi S.p. A on 14 April 2000 for $65 million. According to the original press release,[13] the intention had been that Moto Guzzi would remain headquartered in Mandello del Lario and would share Aprilia's technological, R&D capabilities and financial resources as well. The arrangement would remain short-lived, as Aprilia itself stumbled financially. At the same time Aprilia attempted to diversify in other areas of manufacturing, new Italian laws required helmets for motorcyclists and raising insurance rates for teenage motorcyclists, severely affected the company's profitability.  Nonetheless, Aprilia had committed large sums to renovating the Mandello Moto Guzzi factory \u2013 renovations that were ultimately completed.[14] Ducati Motor Holding again made an offer for Moto Guzzi during Aprilia's financial difficulties, as it had before, when Aprilia had purchased Moto Guzzi in 2000. Other potential buyers included Kymco and the BRP subsidiary Rotax, Kymco reportedly making the highest offer.[15] The Moto Guzzi assembly line closed for a short period in March 2004, due to the financial difficulties.[16] On 30 December 2004, Piaggio & C. S.p.A acquired Aprilia.[6] Moto Guzzi S.p.A officially becomes a Unico Azionista of Piaggio, part of Immsi S.p.A. Investments have allowed introduction of a series of competitive new models in rapid succession. In November 2007, Moto Guzzi unveiled the retro-themed 2008 V7 Classic at the Motorcycle and Bicycle Manufacturers show in Milan, Italy. It was available in Europe in mid-2008, and Moto Guzzi announced plans in late-2008 to make it available to US buyers.[17] The company has begun making limited collectors' editions of Guzzi originals.[18] The following is a list of key people associated with Moto Guzzi since its launch. Founders: Engineers: Racers: (Cardano Reattivo Compatto):  Above a certain power level the competing forces of drive-shaft arrangements can severely disrupt the suspension of a motorcycle (especially at application of throttle), a phenomenon called \"shaft jacking\".  Moto Guzzi introduced its first anti-jacking system with the Daytona in 1993 and evolved that design though the 2005 V11 Sport.   Guzzi later introduced their CARC system, emulating the BMW Paralever design and serving the same function. Kawasaki introduced its Tetra-lever system for similar reasons on the Kawasaki Concours 14 (also known as the 1400 GTR).  Arturo Magni (1925\u20132015) had sold \"parallelogrammo\" rear suspension kit in the early 1980s to resolve similar anti-torque issues. Moto Guzzi's current Breva 750, Nevada 750, and California Vintage fall below the threshold that requires an anti-jacking drive-shaft system. The Breva 1100, Norge, Bellagio, Stelvio and 1200 Sport feature Guzzi's recently patented swingarm system, marketed as Compact Reactive Shaft Drive \u2013 also known as Ca. R.C. or CARC \u2013 introduced with the Breva 1100 in 2005. The system separates the shaft final drive's torque reaction from the suspension via floating torque arms and thereby eliminates the abruptness typical of shaft drive systems on acceleration or throttle-release \u2013 still providing a quiet, reliable and low maintenance drive system. Reviewers have observed excellent braking performance and drive train smoothness attributable to the CARC system.[25][26] By 1928, long-distance motorcycle travel was limited by the lack of an effective rear suspension design.  Until then, alternative designs sacrificed torsional rigidity \u2013 gaining comfort but severely compromising handling. Carlo Guzzi and his brother Giuseppe designed an elastic frame using a sheet-steel box enclosing four springs, together with a swingarm in tubes and sheet metal.  The first Moto Guzzi bike to employ the suspension was named the G.T. (for Gran Turismo, Grand Touring), and to prove the suspension \u2013 and gain publicity for Moto Guzzi \u2013 the brothers conceived a challenging 4,000-mile (6,400\u00a0km) journey from Mandello del Lario to Capo Nord in northern Norway. Despite the very poor condition of European roads at that time, Giuseppe Guzzi reached the Arctic Circle in four weeks. The elastic frame rear suspension was immediately introduced to production machines, transforming the usability of the motorcycle as an everyday form of transportation.  In 2006, Moto Guzzi retraced the 'raid' of 1928 to introduce the Norge 1200. The word \"Norge\" is Norwegian for \"Norway\". The Moto Guzzi Grand Prix V8, introduced in 1955, was a 500\u00a0cc racing motorcycle fitted with a V8 engine using dual overhead camshafts (DOHC). The engine was conceived by Giulio Carcano, Enrico Cantoni, Umberto Todero, Ken Kavanagh and Fergus Anderson just after the 1954 Monza Grand Prix and designed by Dr. Carcano.[27] The bore and stroke of the engine were 44.0\u00a0mm \u00d7\u00a040.5\u00a0mm (1.73\u00a0in \u00d7\u00a01.59\u00a0in): there were two valves per cylinder. Power was in the region of 80\u00a0bhp (60\u00a0kW) at 12,000\u00a0rpm, approximately 10\u00a0to 15\u00a0bhp (7.5\u201311.2\u00a0kW) more than the rival 4-cylinder MV Agustas and Gileras. The engine and the bike were unprecedented. The motorcycle proved capable of achieving 172\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h)\u2014thirty years before the speed was reached again in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. However, the Otto Cilindri proved difficult to ride, as well as complex and expensive to build and maintain\u2014bikes suffered broken crankshafts, overheating and seizing\u2014all in addition to the danger the bike posed to the racers themselves. By 1957 there were two bikes available and no one willing to race the bike without further development and the bike was withdrawn. In 1950 Moto Guzzi created the first motorcycle wind tunnel,[4] La Galleria del Vento, capable of testing 1:1 prototypes at the Mandello del Lario works, thereby allowing the company to market an integral fairing. The wind tunnel enabled racers to mimic real-life riding conditions and optimize their seating and body position at varying racing speeds \u2013 an unprecedented advantage for racing and production motorcycles. In motorcycle prototyping, Moto Guzzi could refine the air stream around the motorcycle itself, develop an envelope of still air around the rider, reduce frontal area, optimize air penetration, and maximize fuel economy. The wind tunnel design is a modification of the open-circuit Eiffel type (after Gustave Eiffel, designer of the Eiffel tower in Paris), consisting of three sections. Air is drawn into the \"Air Duct\" with an aperture of 8.2\u00a0m (26.9\u00a0ft), air speed increases as it is passed through smaller and smaller diameters reaching max wind speed in the \"Test Chamber\" with a diameter of 2.6\u00a0m (8.5\u00a0ft), and finally is exhausted through the \"Outlet/Discharge\" duct containing the fan mechanism \u2013 a three-bladed variable speed propeller driven by a 310\u00a0hp (231\u00a0kW) electric motor. Located outside of the testing chamber adjacent to the central section, a control room houses fan mechanism controls and the measuring instruments. Outside of the chamber is a large dial \"Scala Convenzionale\" or \"Conventional Scale\"  to indicate the varying degree of resistance offered by the motorcycle (and rider) to the passing air. Around the circumference of the dial, red lights at each degree provide a visual indicator to the rider and test personnel. This large scale remains visible to the rider in the tunnel during testing and by repositioning himself on the bike he can determine the changing and optimal resistance. A second measurement tool was an alcohol-filled micro-manometer connected to a Pitot tube placed at a 90\u2013degree angle to the airflow in the tunnel. It is unknown to what extent the wind tunnel is used currently. The December 2005 press release for the Norge 1200 states that the bike was \"thoroughly tested\" in the Mandello wind tunnel.[5] Aprilia, a company in the same group as Moto Guzzi, maintains a relationship with the aerodynamics program at the University of Perugia, where computer simulations combined with practical tests (done in smaller tunnels using scale models) can more effectively and economically provide accurate testing and feedback. The Ercole (Hercules), produced in 1928, was capable of carrying an 800\u00a0lb (363\u00a0kg) load.[28] Guzzi built a range of \"goods vehicles\", from 50\u00a0cc to 500\u00a0cc, between 1928 and 1980. Though the design criteria of a scooter have grown increasingly fluid, historically a scooter featured small wheels \u2013 especially in post-war Italy (due to huge stockpiles of landing-gear tyres for fighter planes, made redundant with the ending of the war and sold off as surplus). The configuration, along with a compact engine, allowed the scooter its trademark step-through design. With the 1950 introduction of the Galletto 160, Moto Guzzi developed a large-wheel scooter. The larger and heavier wheels afforded greater gyroscopic force and thereby greater balance. Large-wheeled scooters also reduced vulnerability to pot-holes. The Galletto not only offered larger wheels, it carried its own spare. Moto Guzzi models currently in production include the MGX-21, V7 III, V9, California 1400 cruiser, Griso 1200 sport/standard hybrid, Eldorado, and Audace.  Recent models have included the Norge 1200 sport tourer/GT, Stelvio dualsport, 1200 Sport and MGS-01 Corsa sportbikes, Breva 750, Breva 1100 and Breva 1200, as well as the Nevada and Bellagio. In 2019, Guzzi released the V85 TT Adventure which comes in two varieties; a streetwise version for urban commutes and road trips, and a rally-style package with a more off-road focus.[29] Guzzi has made a number of historic racing and military motorcycles. The historic racing heritage is best epitomized in the Le Mans model range, still held today to be a styling masterpiece and motorcycle design as an art form.[30] Through various periods of its history, Moto Guzzi has produced models specifically for military and police forces. The Italian police and military and various US police departments (e.g. LAPD) have used Moto Guzzi bikes in their fleets. Guzzi currently markets police versions of model range \u2013 the Breva (all three models) most commonly, as well as the Norge, adopted by Berlin police.[31] Since 1921, Moto Guzzi headquarters have been located in Mandello del Lario on the Lecco branch of Lake Como. The facility began at a size of 300\u00a0m2 (3,200\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), and by the early 1950s Moto Guzzi covered 24,000\u00a0m2 (260,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) with a workforce of over 1,500.  As of 1999, the complex included one, two and three story buildings of over 54,000\u00a0m2 (580,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), operating at approximately 50% of production capacity.[12] During its ownership tenure, Aprilia considered moving the entire operation to Monza, under protest from the Guzzisti and Mandello factory workers.  Instead, Aprilia renovated the factory in 2004 at a cost of $45 million.[28] The original Mandello site remains home to the company's headquarters, the production facility, the historic wind tunnel, the company library, and the museum. The Moto Guzzi Museum displays models from the company's history, engines that retrace Guzzi's engineering history, and a series of important prototypes. The museum is open to the public, and includes a gift shop featuring books, clothing and accessories. Moto Guzzi currently employs roughly 250 to 300 employees, making over 10,000 bikes per year. For decades, the Moto Guzzi factory carried a set of internally lit block letters along the rooftop (and also over the entry gate) spelling \"Moto Guzzi\". In May 2007, the original roof sign, old and worn, was replaced with a new brighter sign carrying the current official logo and script. At the same time, the factory entrance gate received a new rectangular version of the sign. Since 2001, Moto Guzzi has annually hosted Giornate Mondiali Guzzi, also known as GMG or World Guzzi Days, inviting fans to Mandello. In 2006 over 15,000 Guzzi fans from over 20 countries traveled to Mandello for the event.[5] ",

At the outbreak of World War II, Rumi became involved in the manufacture of armaments, miniature submarines and torpedoes. After the end of the war in 1950, Rumi decided to get involved in the manufacture of lightweight motorcycles. It was also decided to base the powerplant on the horizontal twin two stroke unit of 125\u00a0cc capacity. In 1952, with the popularity of scooters, Rumi started manufacturing the Squirrel or Scoiottolo - a cast aluminum monocoque body with tubular swinging arm rear suspension and teleforks with 14\u00a0inch wheels and three gears. Subsequent models had a four speed gearbox and electric starter and were reputed to be the fastest scooters then in production.[1] In 1952, Rumi was producing the \"sports\" and \"super sport\" motorcycle models (single and twin carburettor versions respectively).[2] The \"super sport\" was superseded by the \"Competizione\" or \"Gobbetto\", a pure factory racer. 1954 brought the production of the Formichino or Little Ant scooter, which was reputedly designed by Ing Salvatti.  A \"Competizione\" won the Italian National Championship in 1954. The entire body (with exception of the front forks, crash rails and legshields) was produced in cast aluminium, with the front and rear castings bolted to the engine to form a monocoque which resulted in a light and rigid construction. The rear swinging arm, chaincase and silencer box were also constructed in cast aluminium. These models originally HAD 8\u00a0inch wheels, but by 1958 they reverted to 10\u00a0inch which gave a better stability and ground clearance.[3] During 1955, the \"Competizione\" was superseded by the \"Junior Corsa\" and \"Junior Gentleman\". In 1958, Rumi also produced a sports version called the \"Tipo Sport\" which had a 22\u00a0mm carburettor, larger exhaust pipes and a higher compression ratio. In 1957/58 and 1960, Rumi won the famous Bol d'Or 24-hour races at Montlhery in France and subsequently Rumi produced the Bol d'Or scooter named after the race. In the UK, it sported dropped handlebars, chrome plated aluminium cylinders and twin carburettors but the French version favoured the Bol d'or with a single 22\u00a0mm carburettor. Unfortunately, during the 1960s, Rumi went into liquidation and Donnino Rumi, the archangel of the Rumi motorcycles and scooters went back to his prime love of being a sculptor and artist.  ",

            "text": "Motobi was an Italian motorcycle manufacturer in production between 1950 and 1977. The brand was revived by Austrian company Michael Leeb Trading GmbH in partnership with Demharter GmbH in 2010.[1] In 2010, as well as selling a range of 50\u00a0cc (3.1\u00a0cu\u00a0in) scooters, the brand provides sponsorship for the JiR motorcycle racing team in the Moto2 class.[2] Motobi was established in Pesaro, Italy in 1949, by Giuseppe Benelli, initially trading under the name Moto 'B' Pesaro. This was shortened to Motobi in the 1950s.[3]  After a family disagreement in 1948, Giuseppe Benelli, one of the six brothers and an engineer of some talent, decided to go his own way. He stayed in Pesaro, but moved to separate premises. Giuseppe launched the Moto 'B' marque selling small two-stroke motorcycles and scooters. In 1953, Motobi introduced a 200cc horizontal two-stroke twin called the B200 Spring Lasting. Its innovative pressed steel frame and horizontal cylinder layout were to become the trademark for many future Motobi bikes. The B200 motor was a clean, streamlined, very modern appearing unit, which was soon nicknamed the \"egg\" for its distinctive shape. Giuseppe and his sons Luigi and Marco continued to work on improving Motobi products, and envisioned a four-stroke, single-cylinder variant of the B200. In late 1955, the two-stroke twin cylinder B200 was abandoned entirely, and two different new models, both called \"Catria\" were introduced, one at 125cc and the other at 175cc. Both were four-stroke four speed singles, designed by freelance engineer Piero Prampolini. These improved singles became the focus of Motobi production, beating Moto Aermacchi's 175cc Chimera (which had a similar horizontal single-cylinder engine configuration) to market by a year. Not long afterward, Giuseppe Benelli died, leaving the company in the hands of his two heirs. Once in charge of the company, they hired a young former racer and tuner named Primo Zanzani to develop the new Catria machine into a factory racing machine. Italian semi-professional road racing (called MSDS for Moto Sportive Derivate dalla Serie) and road hill climbing races were popular, and the tough little motorbike was soon earning a reputation among the Italian riders, who called it the \"power egg\". Bright decals lauding Motobi's racing championships started appearing on the little bikes' gas tanks, each version more colorful than the last. In America, where the Eisenhower-era economy was good, sales of motorcycles and other leisure products were booming. The Benelli company saw opportunity in the New World, and also right next door, under the roof of their little cousin, Motobi. Motobi was acquired by the larger Benelli company in 1962, a move that would not only bring the family back together under the Gruppo Benelli-Motobi name, but also swell the workforce to around 550 employees, and increase production to a notable 300 machines per day. Many of these machines were exported to the United States badged as Benelli models. ",

            "text": "MV Agusta, originally Meccanica Verghera Agusta, is a motorcycle manufacturer founded on 12 February 1945 near Milan in Cascina Costa, Italy.[1] The abbreviation MV stands for Meccanica (mechanics) Verghera, the hamlet where the first MVs were made. The company manufactured small-displacement, caf\u00e9 racer-style motorcycles (mostly 125 to 150\u00a0cc) through the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1960s, small motorcycle sales declined, and MV started producing larger displacement cycles in more limited quantities. A 250\u00a0cc, and later a  350\u00a0cc twin were produced, and a 600\u00a0cc four-cylinder evolved into a 750\u00a0cc. The MV Agusta company was successful at racing during its founder's lifetime, winning multiple Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championships through 1976. The MV Agusta company began as an offshoot of the Agusta aviation company formed by Count Giovanni Agusta in 1923. The Count died in 1927, leaving the company in the hands of his wife and sons, Domenico, Vincenzo, Mario and Corrado. Count Vincenzo Agusta together with his brother Domenico formed MV Agusta at the end of the Second World War as a means of saving the jobs of employees of the Agusta firm and also to fill the post-war need for cheap, efficient transportation.  The brothers had a passion for mechanical workings and for motorcycle racing. Much like Enzo Ferrari, they produced and sold motorcycles almost exclusively to fund their racing efforts. They were determined to have the best Grand Prix motorcycle racing team in the world and spared no expense on their passion. MV Agusta produced their first prototype, called \"Vespa 98\", in 1945. After learning that the name had already been registered by Piaggio for its Vespa motorscooter, it was referred to simply by the number \u201c98\u201d. In 1948, the company built a 125\u00a0cc two-stroke single and entered Franco Bertoni in the Italian Grand Prix. Bertoni won the event held in Monza and instantly put the new motorcycle manufacturer on the map. In the 1949 season, the 125\u00a0cc, or ultra light weight class, gained new prestige. More motorcycle manufacturers were competing in the inaugural world championships that were held in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The Mondial 125\u00a0cc DOHC design dominated the 1949 season. The MV riders placed ninth and tenth in the final standings. In 1950, Arturo Magni and Piero Remor joined the company after working with Gilera. Magni was the chief mechanic and Remor was chief designer.[2]  The 1950 season and 1951 season were development years, as the company adopted the 125 Dohc four-stroke engine. Racing efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the Dutch TT in 1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better. The 1952 season saw the introduction of telescopic forks, full width alloy brake hubs and a sleek fuel tank on the 125 race bike. Power was 15\u00a0bhp (11\u00a0kW) @ 10800\u00a0rpm. Britain's Cecil Sandford piloted the new MV 125 to a 1952 Isle of Man TT victory and went on to win MV Agusta's first world championship. With the success of the 1952 season, independent or \"privateer\" riders could now purchase a \"catalog\" version of the 125 DOHC, now available through the company.  The Sport Competizione racer had many of the same features as the factory bike. These included a multi-plate clutch, gear-driven oil pump, Dell'Orto 27\u00a0mm SS1 carburetor and remote float chamber. The bike was nicknamed the \"Boy Racer\". In 1953, the race engineers adopted the Earles-type forks to help with handling problems on the works racers. The 1953 season saw the introduction of the 350 Four.  MV\u2019s racing efforts now included the 500\u00a0cc, 350\u00a0cc and 125\u00a0cc class. Nineteen fifty-three saw the introduction of a new 175\u00a0cc overhead cam model. MV Agusta produced the 175 CST and CSTL (Turismo Lusso) for street use and soon developed a sportier 175\u00a0cc version with larger carburetor, a larger cylinder head with bigger fins, aluminum wheel rims and plenty of glossy red paint. The first year version (1954) of the 175 Sport featured a beautifully sculpted fuel tank that quickly earned it the unofficial nickname \"Disco Volante\" (flying saucer) as, viewed from the front, the tank shape was reminiscent of a flying saucer. Soon after, MV began offering a very limited-availability racing version 175\u00a0cc \"Super Sport\" for MSDS racing (production club racing) equipped with unusual Earles-design front forks. In 1955, it was superseded by a new and improved Super Sport model with radical new styling and a five-speed gearbox. Its design earned it the nickname \"Squalo\" (Shark). This 175\u00a0cc racing machine was very popular in Britain in the mid-1950s, where tuners learned to bore it out to over 200\u00a0cc capacity.  Racers including Micheal O\u2019Rourke, Derek Minter, and Bob Keeler raced the 175 and 125 Sport Competizione around Europe with a great deal of success. The marketing strategy of \"race it on Sunday, sell it on Monday\" was adhered to, and it worked. MV street motorcycles enjoyed immense popularity throughout Europe. In 1958 American rider Dave Schuler, riding a borrowed and barely modified MV 175 Sport street bike, won the 175 class at the famed Catalina Island GP off-road race, in California. After the 1957 season, the Italian motorcycle manufacturers Gilera, Moto Guzzi and Mondial jointly agreed to withdraw from Grand Prix competition due to escalating costs and diminishing sales. Count Agusta originally agreed to withdraw, but then had second thoughts. MV Agusta went on to dominate Grand Prix racing, winning 17 consecutive 500\u00a0cc world championships.[3]  Count Agusta's competitive nature drove him to hire some of the best riders of the time, including Carlo Ubbiali, John Surtees, Mike Hailwood, Giacomo Agostini, Phil Read, and the best engineers, in particular Arturo Magni. The three- and four-cylinder race bikes were known for their excellent road handling. The fire-engine red racing machines became a hallmark of Grand Prix racing in the 1960s and early 1970s. With the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the company lost its guiding force. The company won their last Grand Prix in 1976 and by the end of the season they were out of racing. The company's precarious economic position forced MV Agusta to seek out a new financial partner. A solution was found in the form of public financing giant EFIM (Ente Partecipazioni e Finanziamento Industria Manifatturiera), which demanded that MV Agusta exit the motorcycle industry if were to have any chance of straightening its finances. However, they continued to sell bikes until 1980, when the last machine in the Cascina Costa warehouses was bought up. Count Agusta had plans to expand the MV Agusta brand internationally. In post-Civil War Spain, the Franco regime banned the import of motorcycles and also forbade foreign nationals from settling in Spain, or stating a business there. Brothers Mario and Natale Corando and financiers Enrique Favier and Antonio Sommariva wanted to set up manufacture of MV machines under licence by a local factory, which had licenses and manufacturing permits and therefore have access to raw materials. A deal was struck with Nilo Mas\u00f3 of Alphain Barcelona and MV Alpha was formed in 1948.[4] Sales were good, but because of the limited facilities of Alpha, production could not be increased. The licence to produce MV motorcycles was transferred to the larger and better equipped Avello factory in the Natahoyo neighbourhood of Gij\u00f3n in Asturias in 1951, creating the MV Avello brand.[5] Production in Spain continued until 1972.[6] Cagiva purchased the MV Agusta name trademarks in 1991. In 1997 it introduced the first new MV Agusta motorcycle. The new bikes were four-cylinder 750\u00a0cc sports machines, the F4 range, which included a series of limited production run models, such as the all black paint work SPR model (Special Production Racing) which was featured in the movie I, Robot. In 2004 they introduced their first 1,000\u00a0cc bike. 2004 marked the end of production for the 750 Sport machines, with limited production of 300 SR (Special Racing) models in the traditional red and silver livery. MV Agusta also made a limited number of F4 750\u00a0cc and F4 1,000\u00a0cc Senna editions in memory of the late Formula One champion, Ayrton Senna, an avid Ducati and MV Agusta collector, in aid of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, his charity foundation in Brazil for children and young people. Three hundred of each model were made in the early 2000s. They also produce a range of 750 and 910 naked bikes called the Brutale. Production is limited, as it is the policy of the company to produce an elite machine similar to Ferrari in motor cars.  They do not compete directly with Japanese manufacturers, whose motorcycles typically sell for considerably lower prices; rather, they compete with other Italian models such as Ducati's sports bikes 996, 998, 999, 1098, and the naked Monster. In 2005 MV Agusta introduced the Tamburini 1000, which is named after its creator, Massimo Tamburini, who had previously worked for Ducati, where he designed the Ducati 916.  Cycle World and Australian Motorcycle News magazine named it the best sportbike in the world.[citation needed] Tamburini designed the Ducati 916 sports bike (predecessor of the 748 and 996 series) which marked the return of Ducati as a successful motorcycle manufacturer in the early twenty-first century. The MV Agusta F4 refined the innovative design of the 916. Claimed power of the new F4 312R model is 183\u00a0hp (136\u00a0kW). In 1999 the Cagiva group was restructured for strategic purposes and MV Agusta become the main division, comprising Cagiva and Husqvarna. Heavily in debt, the manufacturer was bought by Malaysian car maker Proton in December 2004 for \u20ac70 million. In December 2005, Proton sold MV Agusta to GEVI SpA, a Genoa-based financing company related to Carige, for a token one euro excluding debt. By 2006 GEVI SpA, with 65% of the share capital, had refinanced MV Agusta allowing the company to continue operating in its native Italy. In July 2007, MV Agusta Motor SpA sold the Husqvarna motorcycle brand to BMW for an undisclosed amount.[7] According to MV Agusta president Claudio Castiglioni, the sale was a strategic step to concentrate all of the company's resources in order to expand MV Agusta and Cagiva's presence in the international markets, having more financial resources for new model development.[7] Following years of stalled ownership, the Guggenheim's \"Art of the Motorcycle\" icon, the F4 model, was ready for a refresh, but the financial status of the company did not allow it. On July 11, 2008, Harley-Davidson announced they had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the MV Agusta Group for US$109 million (\u20ac70m),[8][9]  completing the acquisition on August 8, 2008.[10] On October 15, 2009, Harley-Davidson announced that it would divest its interest in MV Agusta[11] and on August 6, 2010, it announced that MV Agusta had been sold to Claudio Castiglioni and his wholly owned holding company, MV Agusta Motor Holding, S.r.l. MV Agusta announced that for the first three months of 2010 bike sales increased by 50%.[12] On October 31, 2014, Mercedes-AMG announced a long term partnership with the motorcycle brand and the acquisition of a 25% minority stake.[13] This followed similar acquisition strategy by rival Ducati, now in partnership with Audi. Towards the end of March 2016, media reports started to appear which indicated that MV was again experiencing serious financial problems (including a debt of \u20ac40 million) and that it had obtained a concordato in continuit\u00e0 aziendale order which would, in the short-term at least, protect it against creditor claims whilst it attempted to find new sources of capital.[14] This was followed in early April by reports that MV was negotiating the repurchase of AMG's 25% stake in the company and looking for a new major investor, whilst retaining the majority shareholding of the Castiglioni family.[15]  Even of greater concern, were reports that MV were not delivering any spare parts and that the factory might have ceased production.[16] A refinance was announced in October 2016, with funds from Black Ocean Group. In March 2018, the CEO of MV Agusta, Giovanni Castiglioni, announced that the company was working on three new motorcycles based on a new 1,000 cc engine.  The bikes would consist of a naked roadster, a caf\u00e9 style roadster, and a replacement of the F4 superbike that will cease production in December 2018. The F4 replacement could be electric/gas hybrid, reportedly making more than 300 horsepower, and potentially would not be ready for production until 2021.[17] Timur Sardarov, MV Agusta Motor CEO, entered into an agreement with the Chinese Loncin Motor Company in July 2019, to jointly produce 350 and 500 cc motorcycle. Development work and production will be carried out by MV, using the existing 675/800 cc triple as a base for the engine. Machines will be marketed by both MV and Loncin's upmarket brand VOGE.[18] The name of MV Agusta became popular in 1948 when Franco Bertoni won the 125\u00a0cc in the Italian Grand Prix. By that time MV Agusta adopted the commercial slogan: \"Racing experience at the service of mass production\". The manufacturer won its first world championship in 1952 with Cecil Sandford in the 125\u00a0cc class. Starting a domination in all classes, MV Agusta won the 125\u00a0cc, 250\u00a0cc, 350\u00a0cc and 500\u00a0cc titles simultaneously in 1958, 1959 and 1960. The Italian manufacturer made an impressive streak conquering all 500\u00a0cc class riders' championships between 1958 and 1974. MV Agusta retired from Grand Prix racing at the end of the 1976 season, having won 270 Grand Prix motorcycle races, 38 World Riders' Championships and 37 World Constructors' Championships with legendary riders such as Giacomo Agostini, Mike Hailwood, Phil Read, Carlo Ubbiali, Gary Hocking and John Surtees. MV Agusta won the following world titles: MV Agusta also won races in the famous Tourist Trophy. Giacomo Agostini made his Tourist Trophy debut in 1965 in the junior class on an MV 350 three-cylinder and finish third. He participated in 16 TT races, all on MV Agustas, he won the race 10 times, retired three times and was on the podium in the other races. He completed a senior-junior double in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972. Mike Hailwood won the Tourist Trophy on an MV Agusta four times, three in senior class and one in junior class. John Surtees turned to MV Agusta in 1956 and won the senior class. In 1958, he finished the junior and senior classes in first position, a feat he repeated in 1959. He also won the 1960 edition. MV Agusta won the Tourist Trophy 34 times. Although there were no factory racing efforts, independent (\"privateer\") teams were racing the F4 750. In 2003 Big Show Racing of Chicago, Illinois, USA, fielded an F4 750 in the Formula USA, Daytona International Speedway 200\u00a0Mile Team Challenge. The team placed second overall with riders Larry Denning and Aaron Risinger piloting the bike.[19] In 2004 the company made a semi-official return to racing, backing the MV Agusta Deutschland team in the IDM German Superbike championship: J\u00f6rg Teuchert claimed two wins riding a F4 1000S, marking the company's return to a victory since Agostini's 1976 German Grand Prix win. In 2005 the racing activities were expanded to the FIM Superstock 1000 Cup with Italian teams EVR Corse and Gimotorsports. MV Agusta won the Italian Superstock Championship in 2006 with Luca Scassa, 30 years after its last title (Agostini's 1976 500cc Italian Championship). In 2008 Scassa won the Italian Superbike Championship on a  factory-backed machine from the racing department in Schiranna, Varese Italy.[20] Team Fast by Ferracci entered two F4s for Luca Scassa and Matt Lynn in the 2007 AMA Superbike Championship season. The company planned its return to racing for the 2008 Superbike World Championship season: Carl Fogarty's English-based Team Foggy Racing was going to run the team;[21] However the project was aborted due to a lack of sponsorship.[22] In 2013 two MV Agusta F4-RR were entered by Grant Racing in the British Superstock Championship. The MV Agusta F3 675 competed in the 2013 Supersport World Championship season with two bikes managed by Team ParkinGO; Roberto Rolfo and Christian Iddon rode the bikes achieving three podiums. In 2014 MV Agusta made the official return to racing establishing the MV Agusta Reparto Corse works team, managing both World Superbike and Supersport activities. In 2018 it was announced that MV Agusta would return to Grand Prix racing as well with Forward Racing in Moto2.  The new bike will begin testing in July for a return to racing in the 2019 season.  It will be the first time since 1976 that MV Agusta will have an entry on the grand prix entry list when it dropped out due to financial difficulties.[23] In November 2018, Stefano Manzi and Dominique Aegerter were announced as the team's two riders in the manufacturer's return to Grand Prix racing. The new bike also features a new engine package built for it. The aging Honda CBR600RR inline-4 engine\u2014which had been used since the inaugural Moto2 season back in 2010\u2014was replaced by a 765 cc (46.7 cu in) triple cylinder engine developed by Triumph Motorcycles based on the Street Triple RS 765.

            "text": "Officine Nardi was an Italian automobile and racing car maker, named for their creator. Enrico Nardi was a racing mechanic, engineer, and driver who got his start with Lancia. He test drove the first car built by Auto Avio Costruzione in Modena, where many ex-Lancia colleagues joined him.[1] In 1932,[1] Nardi joined with Augusto Monaco to create the Nardi-Monaco Chichibio.[2] It used an air-cooled 998 cc 61 c JAP of 65\u00a0bhp (48\u00a0kW), 10\u00a0bhp (7.5\u00a0kW) more than the 1750 cc (107 in3)  Alfa Romeos of its competition,[3] transversely mounted and coupled to a five-speed gearbox,[3] but unusually, driving the front wheels.[3] Weighing only 672\u00a0lb (305\u00a0kg),[3] it proved capable of 180\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph).[citation needed] This was enough to win several Italian hillclimbs,[3] including by Giulio Aymini in 1932. Beginning in 1948, Nardi joined with and Renato Danese and established a workshop  in Via Vincenzo Lancia, Torino, building racing cars, prototypes, and small-series special designs. The 750 Nardi-Danese (or 750ND) was a tiny machine, assembled on a Fiat 500 chassis, powered by a 50\u00a0bhp (37\u00a0kW) 746 cc BMW flat twin motorcycle engine in the extreme nose with its cylinder heads (sometimes) exposed and a single headlight in the extreme nose.[4] Despite the engine mounting, view over the nose was adequate, and unlike the Chicibio, the rear wheels were driven.[5] It used a multi-tube chassis and was available as a monoposto (one-seater, or GP type) or due posti (two-seater, sports racer, when fitted with cycle fenders).[6] Its competition, mostly superannuated MG Midgets[6] were no match for it,[6] though it faced more competition from Bandinis. The miniature marvel[6] dominated circuit, hillclimb, and open road events. Nardi himself raced the monoposto in the Coppa d'Oro delle Dolomiti 'climb, winning in both 1947 and 1948. There were also three entered  in the 1952 Targa Florio; all failed to finish. The 750ND remained competitive well into 1953, against the growing power of Ferrari and Maserati; at the Susa-Moncenisio 'climb, a 750ND was eighth, only 2% slower than the Ferrari of Andr\u00e9 Simon.[5] It also made reputations for  a couple of drivers, in particular later Lancia pilot Gino Valenzano.[5] For 1947, the Nardi-Danese 1500 Sport was built for Marco Crespi, coupling two 746 cc in series on an Auto Avio Costruzioni 815 chassis.[7] Around the same time, he traced the original Ferrari straight-eight castings, made in Bologna, and fitted them with 508 heads and an assortment of internal parts, to create a 1\u00bd liter and a 2-liter car.[5] In 1948 and 1949, the company built Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 variations in two series. Nardi established his own workshop in the Via Lancia in 1951, focusing on prototypes and tuning equipment. Here, he designed or built several prototypes, including: After the failure of the bisiluro, Officine Nardi ceased work on car prototypes in the mid-1950s and turned to aftermarket such as manifolds, crankshafts, camshafts. It has become best known for the Nardi steering wheel, introduced in 1951 in walnut, since but mostly using African mahogany. The Nardi wheel was first fitted to a 1952 Pegaso.[16] After Nardi's death in 1966, the officine was run by Barbero until 1969, then by Iseglio. Nardi-Personal Website ",

It designs, produces and markets sofas, armchairs and living room accessories. Natuzzi is Italy's largest furniture house and the company with the greatest global reach in its sector. In 1993, Natuzzi Group became the only foreign furniture company to list on Wall Street. It is headquartered in Santeramo in Colle, Apulia, Italy.[1] Pasquale Natuzzi was very young when he started his career. The son of a cabinet-maker, in 1959 at 19 years of age he opened a workshop in Taranto with three collaborators, producing sofas and armchairs for the local market. In 1962 he moved to Matera where he began to gain commercial experience. In 1967, still in Matera, Pasquale Natuzzi returned to the production of sofas and armchairs, this time on an industrial scale. In 1972 he founded Natuzzi Salotti S.r.l. One year later, following a fire that completely destroyed the Matera factory, Pasquale Natuzzi decided to relocate production to Santeramo in Colle (Bari \u2013 Italy), which is the modern-day headquarter of the Group. Somewhere about the middle of the 1970s, Natuzzi took part for the first time in a furniture fair in Bari. Here started first contacts with customers from the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan. In 1976 Natuzzi exported 60% of the turnover in those countries, while 40% was realized in Italy. The beginning of the 1980s was the turning point in Natuzzi Group's growth. During a trip to the United States, Pasquale Natuzzi spotted an opportunity to carry out a radical change of direction: \"democratizing\" the leather sofa, once a product for an elite niche. The first sofa sold at $999 in the United States was a Natuzzi, at Macy's. Following the success in the United States, in 1985 Natuzzi Upholstery Inc. was established. Based in New York, the company was especially designed for the needs of its North American clients.[clarification needed] In 1998, further confirmation of the Group's strong ties with the American market was given by the inauguration in High Point, North Carolina, of a futuristic-looking building, designed by the architect Mario Bellini, housing the offices of Natuzzi Americas, with a showroom measuring 8,000 square metres. With North American expansion continuing, the Group then went on to strengthen its presence in Italy and throughout Europe. The 1990s saw the opening in Taranto, on Pasquale Natuzzi's initiative, of the first shop in the franchising chain Divani & Divani by Natuzzi. There are 274 Natuzzi stores worldwide (mainly in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, France, Switzerland, China, and Australia), and 335 Natuzzi Galleries, mainly in the United States and Northern Europe. Today Pasquale Natuzzi personally oversees strategic activities relating to strengthening the brand with investments in product innovation and research, marketing, communication and staff training, working alongside the Group's managers to define future strategies.[citation needed] The Group's product offering is divided into three brands. Natuzzi Italia is the \"made in Italy\" brand dedicated to the medium to high-end market. The sofas and armchairs of the Natuzzi Italia collection are complemented by a selection of home furnishings, lamps, accessories, and living room furniture. Natuzzi Italia products are distributed through single-brand point of sales: Natuzzi Store and Natuzzi Gallery (shop-in-the-shop) Leather Editions.  Natuzzi Editions is the brand that provides a wide range of sofas and armchairs in leather, available in different designs and functions.  Private Label (Softaly) is a sales program dedicated to key accounts.[2] ",

Based in Giavera del Montello, Italy, the brand was bought from Benetton by the Tecnica Group in 2003.[1][2] In 1939, after years of experience as traders in hides, the brothers Adriano and Oddone Vaccari founded \u201cNordica\u201d in Montebelluna, making casual footwear. In the after-war years Nordica specialised in ski boots, although continuing to supply the market with cross-country ski shoes and climbing boots. Work was still seasonal and the equipment manual.  In 1950 Zeno Col\u00f2 gave his name to a Nordica ski boot and to a revolutionary lining designed by Colmar. Zeno became World Champion with Nordica both in the downhill and the giant slalom of the 1950 World Championships in Aspen, Colorado and gave his name to a ski boot made by the company in Trevignano. The 60\u2019s saw radical transformations: 1963 marked the introduction of the buckle, a fastening system conceived in Austria and applied for the first time in Italy by Nordica. The great innovation of that year, however, was the all-polyurethane ski boot; specific moulds (one for the right boot and one for the left) and injection presses were developed.  1968 was a crucial year with regard to company technical decisions: the leather upper of the traditional models was plastic-coated externally using polyurethane or pvc and the cuff was raised. Nordica set up its first affiliate in the United States, which was the result of an agreement between Nordica and Rossignol. Other affiliates were opened in Austria, Japan, Switzerland, France and Germany.  In 2003 the Nordica brand was purchased by Tecnica Group. The new corporate strategy is aimed at the ski sector with particular attention being paid to racing products and to the competition sector. The feeling between some celebrated names in skiing and the Nordica brand is confirmed once again by the great performances in the World Cup and by the recent World Championships in St. Moritz., further confirmation of Nordica competitive spirit and the great desire to be number one again. In 2006 Nordica presents XBI, a fully integrated balance improvement system.  In 2009 Nordica celebrated 70 years of performance and passion; an important goal reached thanks to a great international team work, racing and freeski athletes and testman suggestions and of course high quality products that, all over these years, confirmed the high level of Nordica brand.

Rossi started to successfully modify existing model engines, which won Italian and worldwide competitions. Throughout the 60's Cesare Rossi manufactured his own engines using engineering and mechanical skills learnt from his father. With the success of manufacturing these engines with the aid of his brother, Cesare Rossi decided to start a family business. Along with his wife Graziosa Barchi, and two sons Mario and Sergio Rossi, Cesare Rossi formed Nova Rossi. Nova Rossi produce a range of engines, manifolds, tuned pipes, glow plugs and other accessories for all forms of radio controlled models. Nova Rossi hold a very high share of sales with radio controlled cars, boats and aircraft. Many world championships have been won in all of these classes, which have led to the company slogan \"World champion engines\" often found on decals and apparel. Nova Rossi produce 60,000 engines a year,[1] and 300,000 glow plugs a year.[1] Exports contribute to 90% of Nova Rossi sales,[2] showing a very high global interest. Cesare Rossi expects a boom in model use through Italy to help improve the percentage of engines currently sold in Italy, which currently stands at 10%.

(Officine Specializzate Costruzione Automobili\u2014Fratelli Maserati S.p.A.) was an Italian manufacturer of racing and sports cars established 1947 in San Lazzaro di Savena, Bologna, by the Maserati brothers, and closed down in 1967. Its name is usually abbreviated to OSCA or Osca. O.S.C.A. was founded in 1947 by Ernesto Maserati (engineering manager) and his two brothers Ettore, and Bindo (operations managers) who had all left Maserati after their ten-year contract with Adolfo Orsi terminated. Ten years earlier, in 1937, the remaining Maserati brothers had sold their shares in the company to the Orsi family, who, in 1940, had relocated the company headquarters to their hometown of Modena, where it remains to this day. The O.S.C.A. factory was at San Lazzaro di Savena outside Bologna,[1] where Maserati were originally made 1926 to 1940. Their basic business goal was to develop an automobile to compete in the 1,100\u00a0cc racing class. O.S.C.A.'s first automobile was the MT4, for Maserati Tipo 4 cilindri. The 1,092\u00a0cc engine, which produced (72\u00a0PS (53\u00a0kW; 71\u00a0hp) at 6,000\u00a0rpm, had a FIAT-derived block, alloy head, and the bodywork was built as a two-seater barchetta. The MT4 first raced in 1948 at the Pescara Circuit and the Grand Prix of Naples, where it was driven to a win by Luigi Villoresi. The engine was modified to 1,342\u00a0cc form (with 90\u00a0PS (66\u00a0kW; 89\u00a0hp) at 5,500\u00a0rpm) in 1949.[2] In 1950, a new DOHC (MT4-2AD) raised power to a maximum of 100\u00a0PS (74\u00a0kW; 99\u00a0hp) at 6,300\u00a0rpm, and in 1953 the engine was enlarged to 1,453\u00a0cc, producing 110\u00a0PS (81\u00a0kW; 108\u00a0hp) at 6,200\u00a0rpm. The all new tipo 372\u00a0DS twin spark engine with 1,491\u00a0cc, which produced 120\u00a0PS (88\u00a0kW; 118\u00a0hp) at 6,300\u00a0rpm, was later used in the O.S.C.A. MT4 TN (for Tipo Nuovo, \"new model\") of 1955. With this new engine, the car received the new name FS\u00a0372, of which five were built.[3] One of these belongs to Sir Stirling Moss, who raced it in historic races across the globe until his retirement in 2011. Versions of this engine went on to be used in coup\u00e9 and convertible models of regular Fiats from 1959 to 1966. These automobiles were mainly barchettas, but a few were built with more luxurious berlinetta bodies by Pietro Frua, Michelotti, and Vignale. A Vignale bodied MT4 was run in the 1,500\u00a0cc class at the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 1954 12 Hours of Sebring was won by drivers Stirling Moss and Bill Lloyd in an O.S.C.A. MT4[4] as part of the Briggs Cunningham Team.[5] From 1951 to 1962, automobiles or engines made by O.S.C.A. also were entered in some Formula One and Formula Two events although they mainly built small sports cars of which some were designed by Pietro Frua. In the World Sportscar Championship OSCA ranked 10th (1953), 4th (1954), 6th (1957), 5th (1958) and 4th (1961). The 750\u00a0cc 70\u00a0hp (52\u00a0kW) type S\u202f187 was introduced in 1956. Weighing 430\u00a0kg (948\u00a0lb), this car had a top speed of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h). The name \"187\" refers to the displacement in cubic centimetres of each cylinder of the engine. In 1959 Jim Eichenlaub won the American H-Mod Title with this OSCA S\u202f187. Operating on a shoestring budget, Eichenlaub often slept in his tow car because there was no money for a motel. However he won his first race at Pensacola in April 1959.[6] The Formula Junior (FJ) used a Fiat engine of 1089\u00a0cc, and saw wins by Colin Davis and Berardo Taraschi in 1959. In 1963 the brothers sold the company to Count Domenico Agusta, owner of MV Agusta,[1] They did design work for Agusta until 1966. One of their final designs was a desmodromic four-cylinder engine. O.S.C.A. ended operations in 1967. The 1500S Coup\u00e9 and Convertible were available with OSCA's twin cam 1491\u00a0cc engine as the 1200 were produced with a Fiat engine. These 90\u00a0PS (66\u00a0kW) 1500S models went on sale in November 1959, with Pininfarina bodywork. The engine was uprated to 1568\u00a0cc and 100\u00a0PS (74\u00a0kW) in the summer of 1962 (1600 S) thanks to a 2\u00a0mm bore increase, and the shell underwent a facelift as the Fiat 1300/1500 replaced the original 1200 in 1963. This continued in production until replaced by the Fiat 124 coup\u00e9/spider, with Fiat's own twin cam engine, in late 1966. OSCA also offered their own cars powered by this engine, such as the Fissore-bodied 1600 GT2.

It was founded in 1899 in Milan as Societ\u00e0 Anonima Officine Meccaniche to manufacture railway rolling stock and car production began in 1918. It disappeared as such in 1975, subsumed into Iveco, but still exists as a forklift builder. The inception of the company resulted from the merger of two companies, Grondona Comi & C and Miani Silvestri & C in 1899. Originally, OM manufactured railway stock. Car production started in 1918, using the plant of the former Brixia-Zust (Brixia-Z\u00fcst), just after OM took over Zust car company of Brescia, Northern Italy. The first OM car, Tipo S305, primarily an old Zust model, appeared in 1918 with a 4712 cc four-cylinder side-valve in-line engine. Further models were Tipo 465 (with a 1327 cc four) in 1919, Tipo 467 (1410 cc) and Tipo 469 (1496cc) in 1921. 1923 saw an all new model, Tipo 665 'Superba' with a 2-litre six-cylinder engine. This model was extremely successful in racing, winning top five positions in the 2-litre class in 1925 and 1926 at the Le Mans but its greatest achievement was the victory in the first Mille Miglia race in 1927 where Ferdinando Minoia and Giuseppe Morandi led home an O.M. '123' at an average speed of 48.27 miles per hour (77.7\u00a0km/h) for 21 hours 4 minutes 48 seconds. Some cars were equipped with Roots superchargers. In 1925 OM began to build trucks and buses, using licensed Swiss Saurer engines and other mechanical components. Ties with Saurer persisted through all of OM's history. OM was taken over by the Fiat Group in 1938 and in the following year passenger car production ceased, and OM became a commercial vehicle and train part manufacturer. Main new product in the WWII post-war era was the Leoncino (1950) a light truck in the 2.0 to 2.5 tons range, which was an immediate success. It became the forefather of several series of heavier but structurally similar models, namely Tigrotto, Tigre, Lupetto, Cerbiatto and Daino, launched between 1957 and 1964. Bus chassis versions of several of these models were also available. In the 60s and 70s the light and medium-weight OM truck ranges were sold in Switzerland as Saurer-OM or Berna-OM, in Austria as Steyr-OM, in France as Unic-OM, and in Germany as B\u00fcssing-OM. In 1968 OM was definitively merged into the Fiat Group as a brand belonging to the Commercial Vehicles division, which also included Fiat and Unic. In 1975 it was absorbed (as part of the Fiat Group) into IVECO and the OM brand disappeared from the truck and bus markets, although it still survives as an independent forklift manufacturer. ",

            "text": "Olivetti S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of typewriters, computers, tablets, smartphones, printers and other such business products as calculators and fax machines. Headquartered in Ivrea, in the Metropolitan City of Turin, the company has been part of the Telecom Italia Group since 2003.[2] The first commercial programmable \"desktop computer\", the Programma 101, was produced by Olivetti in 1964 and was a commercial success. The company was founded as a typewriter manufacturer by Camillo Olivetti in 1908 in Ivrea, Italy. The firm was mainly developed by his son Adriano Olivetti. Olivetti opened its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1930, and its Divisumma electric calculator was launched in 1948. Olivetti produced Italy's first electronic computer, the transistorised Elea 9003, in 1959, and purchased the Underwood Typewriter Company that year. In 1964 the company sold its electronics division to the American company General Electric. It continued to develop new computing products on its own; one of these was Programma 101, the first commercially produced personal computer. In the 1970s and 1980s they were the biggest manufacturer for office machines in Europe and 2nd biggest PC vendor behind IBM in Europe. In 1980, Olivetti began distributing in Indonesia through Dragon Computer & Communication. In 1981, Olivetti installed the electronic voting systems for the European Parliament in Strasburg and Luxembourg.[3] In September 1994, the company launched Olivetti Telemedia chaired by Elserino Piol.[4] From 2003 is part of the TIM Group.  Olivetti was famous for the attention it gave to design: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}[A] preoccupation with design developed into a comprehensive corporate philosophy, which embraced everything from the shape of a space bar to the color scheme for an advertising poster. In 1952, the Museum of Modern Art held an exhibit titled \"Olivetti: Design in Industry\"; today, many Olivetti products are still part of the museum's permanent collection. Another major show, mounted by the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris in 1969, toured five other cities.[6] Olivetti was also renowned for the caliber of the architects it engaged to design its factories and offices, including Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Gae Aulenti, Egon Eiermann, Figini-Pollini, Ignazio Gardella, Carlo Scarpa, BBPR, and many others.[7] From the 1940s to the 1960s, Olivetti industrial design was led by Marcello Nizzoli, responsible for the Lexicon 80 (1948) and the portable Lettera 22 (1950). Later, Mario Bellini and Ettore Sottsass directed design.[8] Bellini designed the Programma 101 (1965), Divisumma 18 (1973) and Logos 68 (1973) calculators and the TCV-250 video display terminal (1966), among others. Sottsass designed the Tekne 3 typewriter (1958), Elea 9003 computer (1959), the Praxis 48 typewriter (1964), the Valentine portable typewriter (1969), and others. Michele De Lucchi designed the Art Jet 10 inkjet printer (1999) (winner of the Compasso d'Oro) and the Gioconda calculator (2001).[9] During the 1970s Olivetti manufactured and sold two ranges of minicomputers. The 'A' series started with the typewriter-sized A4 through to the large A8, and the desk-sized DE500 and DE700 series. George Sowden worked for Olivetti from 1970 until 1990, and designed their first desktop computer, Olivetti L1, in 1978 (following ergonomic research lasting two years). In 1991, Sowden won the prestigious ADI Compasso d'Oro Award for the design of the Olivetti fax OFX420. Olivetti paid attention to more than the importance of product design; graphic and architectural design were also considered pivotal to the company. Giovanni Pintori was hired by Adriano Olivetti in 1936 to work in the publicity department. Pintori was the creator of the Olivetti logo and many promotional posters used to advertise the company and its products. During his activity as Art Director from 1950, Olivetti's graphic design obtained several international awards, and he designed works that created the Olivetti image and became emblematic Italian reference in the history of 20th-century design.[10] Those designers also created the Olivetti Synthesis office furniture series which mainly were used to be installed in Olivetti's own headquarters, worldwide branch offices and show rooms. Olivetti also produced some industrial production machinery, including metal working machines of the Horizon series. Olivetti began with mechanical typewriters when the company was founded in 1909, and produced them until the mid 1990s. Until the mid 1960s they were fully mechanical, and models such as the portable Olivetti Valentine were designed by Ettore Sottsass. With the Tekne/Editor series and Praxis 48, some of the first electromechanical typewriters were introduced. The Editor series was used for speed typing championship competition. The Editor 5 from 1969 was the top model of that series, with proportional spacing and the ability to support justified text borders. In 1972 the electromechanical typeball machines of the Lexicon 90 to 94C series were introduced, as competitors to the IBM Selectric typewriters, the top model 94c supported proportional spacing and justified text borders like the Editor 5, as well as lift-off correction. In 1978 Olivetti was one of the first manufacturers to introduce electronic daisywheel printer-based word processing machines called TES 401 and TES 501. Later the ET series typewriters without (or with) LCD and different levels of text editing capabilities were popular in offices. Models in that line were ET 121, ET 201, ET 221, ET 225, ET 231, ET 351, ET 109, ET 110, ET 111, ET 112, ET 115, ET 116, ET 2000, ET 2100, ET 2200, ET 2250, ET 2300, Et 2400 and ET 2500. For home users in 1982 the Praxis 35, Praxis 40 and 45D were some of the first portable electronic typewriters. Later, Olivetti added the Praxis 20, ET Compact 50, ET Compact 60, ET Compact 70, ET Compact 65/66, the ET Personal series and Linea 101. The top models were 8 lines LCD based portables like Top 100 and Studio 801, with the possibility to save the text to 3.5 inch floppy disk. The professional line was upgraded with the ETV series video typewriters based on CP/M operating system, ETV 240, ETV 250, ETV 300, ETV 350 and later MS-DOS operating system based ETV 260, ETV 500, ETV 2700, ETV 2900, ETV 4000s word processing systems having floppy drives or hard disks. Some of them (ETV 300, 350, 500, 2900) were external boxes which could be connected through optional serial interface to many of the ET series office typewriters, the others were fully integrated with an external monitor which could be installed on a holder over the desk. Most of the ET/ETV/Praxis series electronic typewriters were designed by Marion Bellini. By 1994, Olivetti stopped production of typewriters, as most users had transitioned to Personal Computers.[citation needed] Between 1955 and 1964 Olivetti developed some of the first transistorized mainframe computer systems, such as the Elea 9003. Although 40 large commercial 9003 and over 100 smaller 6001 scientific machines were completed and leased to customers to 1964, low sales, loss of two key managers  and financial instability caused Olivetti to withdraw from the field in 1964. In 1965 Olivetti released the Programma 101, considered the first commercial desktop personal computer. It was saved from the sale of the computer division to GE thanks to an employee, Gastone Garziera, who spent successive nights changing the internal categorization of the product from \"computer\" to \"calculator\", so leaving the small team in Olivetti and creating some awkward situations in the office, since that space was now owned by GE.[11] In 1974 Olivetti released the TC800, an intelligent terminal designed to be attached to a mainframe and used in the finance sector. It was followed in 1977 by the TC1800. Olivetti's first modern personal computer, the M20, featuring a Zilog Z8000 CPU, was released in 1982. In 1983 Olivetti introduced the M24, a clone of the IBM PC using DOS and the Intel 8086 processor (at 8 MHz) instead of the Intel 8088 used by IBM (at 4.77\u00a0MHz). The M24 was sold in North America as the AT&T 6300. Olivetti also manufactured the AT&T 6300 Plus, which could run both DOS and Unix.[12] The M24 in the US also was sold as Xerox 6060. The M28 was Olivetti\u2019s first PC to have the Intel 80286 processor. In 1983 Olivetti produced its M10 laptop computer, a 8085-based workalike of the successful Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100, which it marketed in Europe.[13] These were the first laptops to sell in million-unit quantities, though the Olivetti M10\u00a0[it] itself only attained sales figures in the tens of thousands and went out of production within two years. In 1985 the company acquired a controlling share in the British computer manufacturer Acorn Computers Ltd; a third partner was Thomson SA. Olivetti sold the Thomson MO6 and Acorn BBC Master Compact with brand names Olivetti Prodest PC128 and PC128s respectively. At the same time Olivetti also tried to compete with de: Schneider Euro PC with the MS-DOS based Prodest PC1, but without success. In 1987 Olivetti introduced the LSX line of computers which was based on the Motorola 68k processor. They could run either MOS or Olivetti's Unix, X/OS.[14] In 1989 Olivetti introduced the 80486 based next generation of LSX workstations with the LSX 5020 with EISA-Bus, it was shown in CeBit 1989 as \"Computing Platform CP486\". In 1990, Olivetti had its own distribution network in New Zealand through Essentially Software Ltd.[15] (owned by Gary McNabb) located at Mt. Eden in Auckland and Wellington, where an Olivetti M300-100 16\u00a0MHz PCs with 80386SX CPU were sold for NZ$7395 and used as graphical work station for design houses using Corel Draw as graphical program. The New Zealand distribution stopped in 1991 when Olivetti could not supply their PCs. Olivetti also sold quasi-portable 8086/8088-based PCs with an integrated keyboard and one or two integrated 3.5\" floppy disk drives, running DOS 3.27, an Olivetti OEM version of PC DOS 3.20 with minor improvements like the M21 portable (based on M24) and the M15. Also later Olivetti produced interesting laptops like M111, M211, S20, D33, Philos and Echos series. A very interesting subnotebook was the Olivetti Quaderno, about the same size as an A5 paper \u2013 it was the grandfather of the netbooks introduced 20 years later. Olivetti did attempt to recover its position by introducing the Envision in 1995,[16] a full multimedia PC, to be used in the living room; this project was a failure. Packard Bell managed to successfully introduce a similar product in the U.S. but only some years later.[citation needed] The main problem of the company was its inability to conjugate innovation with the quality standards it had committed itself to, at a time when the margins on the PC market were diminishing as not only the market but also the number of PC clone producers grew.[citation needed] The company continued to develop personal computers until it sold its PC business in 1997. In the 1990s, Olivetti's computer businesses were in great difficulty, reportedly because of the competition from US vendors and new cheap manufacturers for PC components in Taiwan like ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte and so on from which local system builders profited much to offer cheaper PCs than Olivetti did with their own designs. It was on the brink of collapse and had needed government support to stay afloat. A company in transition, it had moved out of the typewriter business into personal computers before embracing telecoms between 1997 and 1999. In the process it had lost around three-quarters of its staff. In 1999, The Luxembourg-based company Bell S.A. acquired a controlling stake in Olivetti, but sold it to a consortium including the Pirelli and Benetton groups two years later. Olivetti then launched a hostile bid for Telecom Italia in February 1999, despite being less than a seventh of the size of its target. In a take-over battle against Deutsche Telekom, and other potential bidders, Olivetti won out and controlled 52.12% of former monopoly Telecom Italia, Italy's #1 fixed-line and mobile phone operator. However, the ownership structure of the merged Olivetti / Telecom Italia was complex and multi-layered with Olivetti took on around $16 billion of extra debt. It was then referred to as the \"Olivetti/Telecom Italia affair\" because of the unpleasant secret affairs behind. After a 2003 reorganization Olivetti became the office equipment and systems services subsidiary of Telecom Italia. In 2003 Olivetti was absorbed into the Telecom Italia group, maintaining a separate identity as Olivetti Tecnost. In 2005, Telecom Italia re-launched the company in the information technology sector, investing \u20ac200 million; at first restoring the original Olivetti brand, then replacing it with Olivetti Tecnost in 2003. In 2007, Olivetti launched the \"LINEA_OFFICE\", designed by Jasper Morrison for Olivetti; a new line of PCs, notebooks, printers, fax machines and calculators. Olivetti today operates in Italy and Switzerland, and has sales associates in 83 countries. Research and development are located in Agli\u00e8, Carsoli and Scarmagno in Italy, and Yverdon, Switzerland. In March 2011 Olivetti began producing the OliPad, its first tablet computer, featuring a ten-inch screen, 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity, Nvidia Tegra 2, Android 2.2.2 and a 1024 x 600 display. It also features an application store, with apps specifically designed by Olivetti for 'business & government'.[17] In 2014 the R&D department in Arnad was sold to SICPA.[18] In 2013, Olivetti launched a series of smartphones called Oliphone:[19] ",

Their products were in the upper price range of writing instruments and had always been manufactured in their factory located in Bologna, Italy. OMAS stands for Officina Meccanica Armando Simoni. The company was founded by Armando Simoni, who also designed the tools and equipment needed to manufacturer the OMAS line of pens. OMAS manufactured a variety of pens, the top line being the faceted Arte Italiana range, as well as a variety of limited edition pens. In their history, they introduced a number of cutting edge designs including the \"Doctor's pen\" (which had a tiny built-in clinical thermometer) and the double-nibbed Itala in the 1920s and the 361 model in the late 1940s whose nib could be used as a hard writer if handled in one position and as a flexible writer in another. Their last major design innovation was the 360, a fountain pen with a triangular body to maximize grip and writing comfort, launched in 1996.[1] The largest size pen manufactured as a non-limited edition in their most current production was the 12-faceted Paragon, the second largest being the Milord. OMAS' product range was last updated in 2005. The Milord model became the size of the pre-2005 Paragon model. OMAS continued to release limited editions based on their earlier style of pens. In 2000, the French company LVMH acquired OMAS from the heirs of Armando Simoni. It was the only writing instrument company in its suite of companies. In October 2007 the Xinyu Hengdeli Group[2] of Hong Kong purchased 90% equity stake in OMAS. Xinyu had a strategic partnership with LVMH and planned to use OMAS for its expansion of luxury goods in the Asian market. The company continued to be unprofitable and in 2011 it was sold to another Chinese company, O-Luxe.[3] O-Luxe decided to close Omas in November 2015 and the company entered voluntary liquidation in January 2016, ceasing all trading.[4] In June 2018 it was announced[5][6] that Ancora, another Italian penmaker, has acquired Omas and that production will be resumed with Omas remaining a separate brand, retaining its classic models and using the materials inherited from Omas.

            "text": "Osella is an Italian racing car manufacturer and former Formula One team. They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points. Named after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing Abarth sports cars in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the European Formula Two Championship for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the BMW-powered Osella FA2. Osella continued in Formula Two in 1976, but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser. Enzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned Formula Three car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with Toyota or Lancia engines competed in the 1976 German and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978. Osella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in 1979, with American driver Eddie Cheever racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of Formula One. While the FA2 was entered on one occasion in 1980 by the Italian privateer Marco Rocca, Osella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by Giorgio Stirano. Powered by Ford Cosworth DFV, it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large Denim branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times. In the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like Giorgio Valentini or Tony Southgate, but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. Jean-Pierre Jarier finished fourth at Imola in 1982 (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C. Despite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few sponsors were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, Kelemata was no more reliable, and others like Landis & Gyr vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from Turin or the region of Piemont. The lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as Alex Caffi and Gabriele Tarquini, while Piercarlo Ghinzani had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as Allen Berg and Franco Forini. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian Jo Gartner his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. Riccardo Paletti also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix. None of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness. In the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory Alfa Romeo engines, both in naturally-aspirated (1983\u201384) and turbo (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works Alfa Romeo 183T, which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the FA1L in 1988 had their origins in the initial Alfa design. The Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date Motori Moderni turbos (which Minardi did not support) or with Cosworth engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T. For 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, Fiat, grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used. After driver Nicola Larini managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at Monza, the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the San Marino Grand Prix before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine. The 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, Cosworth DFR-powered Osella FA1M was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying tyres from Pirelli brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the Japanese Grand Prix, where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending Australian Grand Prix. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the Lotus of Nelson Piquet left Ghinzani with an injured ankle. In 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate Gabriele Rumi, as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's Fondmetal company. During 1990, the team entered a single car for French driver Olivier Grouillard, who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal. The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in hillclimb races, with Maurpo Nesti many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models. A few of those sports cars even found their way to the Can Am series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels. In the 1990s, Osella moved to Atella in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in hillclimb races. In 1995 for instance works team driver Pasquale Irlando won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor Fabio Danti died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship. Hillclimb stars like Franz Tschager and Martin Krisam continue to use Osella cars. Nowadays, the factory was transferred back near Turin, in Verolengo and continue activity building sport cars for hill climbing and minor sport race championship.

The Mod 56 pack howitzer, in service throughout the world, and the 76mm naval gun, adopted by 53 navies and installed on over 1,000 naval vessels, are among OTO Melara's best-known weapons since World War II.[citation needed] From 1 January 2016, the activities of OTO Melara merged into Leonardo-Finmeccanica's Defence Systems Division,[2] within the Electronics, Defence and Security Systems Sector. It was founded in 1905 as a joint venture of Vickers and Terni Steelworks, Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando and Cantieri navali Odero. Investment was also provided by Giuseppe Orlando and Attilio Odero. During World War I, Vickers Terni produced many weapons with calibre 40\u00a0mm and upwards. In 1929 the company was renamed Odero Terni Orlando with the abbreviation OTO. During World War II, mostly heavy guns for battleships were produced. In 1953 the company took the name OTO Melara. Before Italy joined NATO, OTO Melara produced civil products, like tractors and looms, but quickly returned to the production of weapons. On 1 December 2001, the naval artillery division of OTO Melara merged with that of Breda Meccanica Bresciana to form Otobreda. The combined entity produces the DARDO CIWS, Otobreda 76\u00a0mm and Otobreda 127/54 Compact naval guns. OTO Melara's land defence operations are part of the Finmeccanica conglomerate. Vehicles manufactured include: Weapons manufactured includes: Ammunition manufactured include: In the last decade the company has produced between 900 and 1000 GBU-31 and GBU-32 JDAMs on license. At the moment it is working on the production of 500 GBU-39s for the Aeronautica Militare. The naval defence operations produce a wide range of automatic naval artillery, rocket and missile launchers and remote controlled small calibre defence cannons. ",

They are an OEM supplier to a number of manufacturers in addition to aftermarket sales and are a prominent wheel supplier in motorsport. The enterprise was founded in a filling station in Rossano Veneto near Venice in 1971 by Silvano Oselladore and Pietro Zen from whose initials the company takes its name.[1] OZ S.p.A. was officially established as a company in 1978 following an investment by Carto Isnardo SpA.[1] 1989 saw the company's first affiliate set up as OZ Japan began business.[1] In 1992 the company moved to a new factory in its current headquarters location of San Martino di Lupari.[1] In 1999 OZ branched out into motorcycle wheel production in collaboration with Aprilia.[1] Today the company produces alloy wheels for motorsports, aftermarket and OEM applications in addition to motorcycle wheels and custom items for specialist tuners and designers including Bertone, Pininfarina, AMG and Hartge.[1] OZ also produces wheels for Sparco in partnership with their compatriots. Their main competitor is BBS.

            "text": "Pagani Automobili S.p.A. (commonly referred to as Pagani) is an Italian  manufacturer of sports cars and carbon fibre components. The company was founded in 1992 by Horacio Pagani and is based in San Cesario sul Panaro, near Modena, Italy.  Horacio Pagani, who formerly managed Lamborghini's composites department, founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new company worked with Lamborghini on numerous projects, including the restyling of the 25th Anniversary Countach, the Lamborghini LM002, the Lamborghini P140 design concept, and the Diablo. In the late 1980s, Pagani began designing his own car, then referred to as the \"C8 Project\". Pagani planned to rename the C8 the \"Fangio F1\" to honour his friend, the five-time Argentinian Formula One champion Juan Manuel Fangio. In 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being tested at the Dallara wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, Mercedes-Benz agreed to supply Pagani with V12 engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3\u00a0million dollars. The final car was named the Zonda C12, the first of the Zonda line (the Fangio F1 name was dropped out of respect for Fangio, who died in 1995). It was first presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show. In 2005, Pagani announced that it planned to triple its production output within the next three years, and to enter the US market in 2007. On 30 June 2010, Pagani claimed a new record for production-based cars using the Pagani Zonda R and completing the N\u00fcrburgring in 6:47, beating the Ferrari 599XX.[2] Pagani's first model, the Zonda, is powered by a mid-mounted DOHC V12 engine manufactured by Mercedes-Benz's AMG division. The car's design was inspired by jet fighters and the famous Sauber-Mercedes Silver Arrow Group C cars, and features several unique design elements, including its circular four pipe exhaust system. The Zonda's production run ended with the Zonda HP Barchetta. Only three were produced with one unit retained for Horacio Pagani's personal collection and the other two costing US$15M.[3] Pagani announced a variant of the Zonda named \"Zonda Cinque\" which was introduced as a 2009 model. The Cinque is based on the track-only Zonda R, but features a new 678\u00a0hp (687\u00a0PS; 506\u00a0kW) Mercedes-Benz M297 V12 engine, active aerodynamics, and features exterior elements from the newly developed material \"carbon-titanium fibre\", which is stronger and lighter than typical carbon fibre. Only five were produced, all of which were already spoken for.[4] Pagani announced the Zonda Cinque Roadster in July 2009, of which only five were produced. The roadster uses the same Mercedes-Benz M297 V12 engine as the coup\u00e9 version, but has been made lighter and stronger to keep the car structurally rigid. Both the coupe and the roadster accelerate from 0\u201360\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.4 seconds, 0\u2013124\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) in 9.6 seconds and have a top speed of 217\u00a0mph (349\u00a0km/h). The Cinque uses carbon-ceramic brakes from Brembo. They help decelerate the car from 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h)\u20130 mph in 2.1 seconds and 124\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h)\u20130mph in 4.3 seconds. The maximum side acceleration is 1.45g with road tyres. The car produces 750\u00a0kg (1,653\u00a0lb) of downforce at 186\u00a0mph (300\u00a0km/h). [5] At the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, Pagani announced the exclusive Zonda Tricolore, built to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Frecce Tricolori, the Italian Air Force's aerobatic squadron.[6] Originally intended to be limited to a single car, eventually three were produced. The Tricolore is based on a top specification Zonda Cinque, built on a carbon titanium chassis with sequential transmission and titanium exhausts. The mid-mounted 7.3L M297 Mercedes AMG V12 engine produces 670\u00a0hp (679\u00a0PS; 500\u00a0kW), which helps the car achieve a top speed of 217\u00a0mph (349\u00a0km/h) and a 0\u201360\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) acceleration time of 3.2 seconds. The Pagani Huayra, a successor to the Pagani Zonda, was initially revealed online in a press release on January 25, 2011. It was officially revealed at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. The car is named Huayra after the Incan god of wind, Huayra-tata.[7] The engine is a 6.0-litre twin-turbo M158 V12 engine from Mercedes-AMG  producing 720\u00a0hp (730\u00a0PS; 537\u00a0kW)[8] and 1,000\u00a0N\u22c5m (740\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque.[8] The Huayra's  body is made from carbotanium; a composition of carbon fibre and titanium, thus it is reasonably lightweight. The Huayra has been redesigned from the ground up, but shares many visual qualities with its predecessor. The car can accelerate from 0\u201360\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in 3.2 seconds and has a top speed of 235\u00a0mph (378\u00a0km/h). Only 100 units of the Huayra were produced, each costing \u00a31,000,000 without options. An extreme, track focused version of the Huayra called the Huayra BC was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The Huayra BC is named after the late Benny Caiola, a friend of Horacio Pagani, and the first Pagani customer. The Huayra BC has an improved version of the standard Huayra's engine,  producing 755\u00a0PS (555\u00a0kW; 745\u00a0hp) and 1,100\u00a0N\u22c5m (810\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque.[10] The weight is reduced by 132\u00a0kg (291\u00a0lb) to just 1,218\u00a0kg (2,685\u00a0lb), thanks to the use of an all-new material called 'carbon-triax' in the car which Pagani claims is 50% lighter and 20% stronger than regular carbon fibre, giving the car a power-to-weight ratio of 1.62\u00a0kg (3.57\u00a0lb) per horsepower. The Huayra BC uses a lightweight titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped out interior. The tyres are Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tires that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper along with a large rear wing. The car uses an Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission, and has an electro-hydraulic actuation. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes. Only 20 units of the Huayra BC were made, all of which were already sold with each unit costing \u20ac2.1M.[11][12] After 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled in the 2017 Geneva Motor Show.[13]  The design of the car has undergone several changes, with the most noticeable being the rear, with new eyelid-like fixed flaps that continue with the design and eventually end on the rear lights along with the inclusion of vents on the rear engine cover for efficient cooling of the engine, the wheels which are new and are specifically constructed for the car along with Pirelli P-Zero tires, and the addition of a spoiler at the front. The car also uses conventional doors instead of the Gull-wing doors used in the coup\u00e9 as such doors cannot be fitted to an open top car. The car utilises the same twin-turbo V12 engine as the coup\u00e9 but the power is now uprated and is 764\u00a0PS (562\u00a0kW; 754\u00a0hp) at 6,200 rpm and 1,000\u00a0N\u22c5m (740\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 2,400 rpm. The power is delivered to the rear wheels via an all-new Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission which is 40% lighter than its coup\u00e9 counterpart. The car is constructed by an all-new material developed by Pagani called 'carbon triax', which is a combination of tri-axis fibre glass with carbon fibre due to which the roadster weighs 70\u00a0kg (154\u00a0lb) less than its coup\u00e9 counterpart, for a total of 1,280\u00a0kg (2,820\u00a0lb), making it the first roadster lighter than the coup\u00e9. Only 100 will be made, all of which have already been sold.[13]  Pagani says that the car can produce 820 kilograms (1,800\u00a0lb) or 1.8 lateral G-forces. However, this figure is unproven, but if true, Pagani will have set a new record.[14] Continuing its tradition with the Zonda, Pagani produced several bespoke Huayras.

            "text": "Officine Panerai is a luxury Italian watch manufacturer, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Compagnie Financi\u00e8re Richemont S.A. Officine Panerai designs, manufactures and markets watches through authorized dealers and company-owned stores worldwide.[1][3] Giovanni Panerai (1825\u20131897) founded Officine Panerai in Florence, Italy in 1860. The company is headquartered in Geneva and manufactures watches in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland using both movements manufactured in-house and movements manufactured by ETA S.A.[4] Panerai watches, designed and manufactured by Rolex SA, played a role in assisting the frogmen of the Decima Flottiglia MAS in their operations during World War II. Notable products include the Luminor and Radiomir wristwatches. Giovanni Panerai (1825\u20131897) opened up his first watch shop in Florence, Italy in 1860.[5] Giovanni's grandson Guido Panerai (1873\u20131934) expanded the watch shop \"Orologeria Svizzera\" and took over his wife's family business, a mechanical workshop, thus founding a new company with the name G. Panerai e Figlio. This new company became an official supplier to the Regia Marina (the Royal Italian Navy), supplying all kinds of technical equipment and precision instruments.[6] All Panerai watches, except for the GPF 2/56 were designed and manufactured by Rolex SA using pocket watch movements made by Swiss manufacturer Cort\u00e9bert. The main driving forces behind the production of the first professional diving watches were Hans Wilsdorf of Rolex and Giuseppe Panerai. The Florence-based workshop produced wrist-worn diving instruments and, between 1938 and 1970, delivered around 1,600 watches (c. 1000 3646s, 24 6152s, 36 6154s, 500 6152/1s, and 60 GPF 2/56s), most of them to the Italian Marina Militare.[7] The GPF 2/56 (Egiziano Grosso) was produced for the Egyptian Navy in 1956.[8] By 1970, the company ceased to provide watches to the Marina Militare, as they were neither cost-effective nor met the naval specifications. In 1993 it then moved to launch its products in the civilian market. Following its acquisition of Panerai, Richemont repositioned Panerai as a luxury watch brand and increased prices.[9] One of the rarest Panerai watches is a Second World War Military Diver watch. This historic watch was acquired by a British soldier named George H. Rowson in WW2 [10] where he obtained it via a German frogman during a thwarted attempt by the Germans to destroy the Nijmegen Bridge in the Netherlands, in September 1944. Panerai offers watches across four marketing lines: Historic, Contemporary, Manifattura and Special Editions in runs of 500, 1000, 2000 or 4000 units\u2014each carrying an issue number on the case back. The company issues Special Editions by year. For example, in 2006 issued the 1936 California Dial Radiomir special edition, a reissue of the first Panerai model presented to the Italian Marina Militare with production limited to 1936 units.[citation needed] When Ferrari's contract with rival watchmaker Girard-Perregaux expired in 2005, Ferrari and Panerai entered into a five-year agreement to design, manufacture and distribute Panerai watches carrying the Ferrari trademark. The collection was branded Ferrari engineered by Panerai  and consisted of two product lines marketed as  \"Granturismo\" and \"Scuderia\". The collection consisted of 11 models priced between US$5,000 and US$30,000.[11] ",

            "text": "Panini Comics is an Italian comic book publisher. A division of Panini Group, which also produces collectable stickers, it is headquartered in Modena, Italy.[1] The company publishes comic books in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as manga in several non-English-speaking countries through the Planet Manga publishing division. In the United Kingdom, Panini Comics prints its Collectors' Edition (CE) line, which consists of reprints of Marvel US Comics. These are usually 76 pages long (with the occasional 100 page special). Each comic is published every 28 days, with the exception of Astonishing Spider-Man which has been published fortnightly since volume 2. Panini Comics started as en evolution of Marvel Italia, an Italian division of Marvel Comics created in 1994 to publish in Italy all the Marvel titles, whose rights had been previously held by different publishers (Star Comics, Comic Art, Play Press and Max Bunker Press). In December 1994, Marvel Italia was absorbed by Edizioni Panini of Modena, after the latter had been acquired by Marvel Comics. In the years, Panini Comics in Italy has evolved a series of sub-divisions: Subsequently, Marvel Comics sold Panini to a group of investors including Indesit Company. Currently, Panini Comics also publishes in Brazil, France, Germany, the United Kingdom (see next section), Spain, Portugal and Hungary. In Germany and Brazil, it publishes also translation of DC Comics series. It obtained the Marvel UK license in 1995, enabling it to publish reprinted American Marvel Comics titles, and is also the company responsible for printing the Doctor Who Magazine. Panini Comics had been part of Marvel Europe, and had already been reprinting American material across the continent for several years.  Thanks to this licensing deal, reprints of American Marvel Comics material were continued in the UK by Panini from the mid-1990s. Each book contained approximately two or three Marvel US strips in one issue with possibly a \"classic\" comic printed as a substitute for a comic in the current run, whilst being priced at a reasonable level. Initially the lineup consisted of only Astonishing Spider-Man and Essential X-Men and followed the continuity of the US comics, however it was approximately two\u2013three years behind the current run in America. In addition to reprinting the mainstream US comics, Panini also published a monthly (later every three weeks) oversized comic, entitled The Spectacular Spider-Man, for younger readers to accompany Spider-Man: The Animated Series, which began broadcasting in the UK in the mid-90s. Initially, the stories were simply reprints of the US comics based on the series, but eventually the title moved to all-new UK-originated stories, marking the first Marvel UK material featuring classic Marvel characters to be produced since early 1994. Since then Panini extended their line to include other characters within the Marvel Universe. In addition to Essential X-Men and Astonishing Spider-Man came Wolverine Unleashed, in which Wolverine's solo comic was reprinted.  The comic ran for 54 issues before it was renamed Wolverine & Gambit to allow reprints of the Gambit series, and subsequently Wolverine and Deadpool when the Gambit material had been exhausted and Deadpool was introduced as a replacement in 2004. Marvel Heroes Reborn was released in 1997, to introduce the new Heroes Reborn saga, and expand the range of characters in Marvel UK's lineup. It was initially published with only two strips (or 56 pages) but this was expanded to 76 pages (commonly 3 strips) from issue 17 onwards. Unfortunately, this title was short lived due to continuously lagging sales, and was eventually cancelled in 2000. Later titles include Avengers United (later replaced by Avengers Unconquered), Fantastic Four Adventures, Marvel Legends featuring Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, a new The Mighty World of Marvel as well as the introduction of the Ultimate Marvel imprint, consisting of Ultimate Spider-Man and X-Men (which was originally two titles, which merged since it was reprinting the stories too fast for Marvel US to print them) and Ultimate Fantastic Four (cancelled because of low sales, and because it was only a few issues behind the US title by the end). In March 2006, Marvel Entertainment and Panini S.p.A announced that they had \"renewed and expanded their publishing agreement under which Panini retains a master license for producing translated versions of Marvel comics for Europe and selected Latin American countries. The new agreement includes a major expansion of editorial projects in which Panini will originate new content under the creative supervision of Marvel.\"[2] This made them the \"master license holder\" for Europe and parts of Latin American and lead to the development of non-English language titles with Marvel, including Wolverine: Saudade, by Jean-David Morvan and Philippe Buchet,[3] and Daredevil & Captain America: Dead On Arrival, by Tito Faraci and Claudio Villa. Alongside these mainly reprint titles, Panini continues to print Doctor Who Magazine which still features originally produced comics by British creators, something Panini do in their other titles. This includes the first new Captain Britain story by a British creative team in over a decade which was created by Jim Alexander, Jon Haward and John Stokes in Spectacular Spider-Man (UK version) #114 published in March 2005. Also published from 2004 onwards was Marvel Rampage, which like Spectacular Spider-Man was aimed at a younger audience, and similarly featured all-new UK-originated material, this time featuring characters from all across the Marvel Universe. Several of those short stories were written by noted Spider-Man writer Roger Stern. Panini also release their own range of trade paperbacks. These are all reprinted material from the American originals, and can be bought from their online shop. They have also been printing a seemingly highly successful series of A.T.O.M. comics, which followed on from their Action Man, though it was recently cancelled. The UK site also has a popular forum, primarily for discussion of Panini Comics' publications and comics in general as well as promotion of British Comic Conventions. It has around 580 members and 580 posts as of August 2011. This closed down in March 2013 and a new forum was set up by its members.  A new title, Marvel Heroes, was launched in 2008, based on the general formula of Spectacular Spider-Man, with new comic stories from creators like Scott Gray, Al Ewing and John McCrea.[4] Their current comics are: Previous titles include: ",

            "text": " Parmalat S.p.A. is an Italian multinational dairy and food corporation. Having become the leading global company in the production of long-life milk using ultra-high-temperature processing, the company collapsed in 2003 with a \u20ac14bn ($20bn; \u00a313bn) hole in its accounts in what remains Europe's biggest bankruptcy.[3] Since 2011, it has been a subsidiary of French group Lactalis. Today, Parmalat is a company with a global presence, having operations in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, China, and South Africa. Still specializing in UHT milk and milk derivatives (varieties of yogurt, cheese, butter, ice cream, etc.), the group also sells fruit juices distributed under the brand names Lactis, Santal, Mal\u00f9, and Kyr. Its worldwide operations include almost 140 production centres and some 16,000 employees, with 5,000 Italian dairy farms supplying it. Its shares are listed on the Borsa Italiana. In 1961, Calisto Tanzi, a 22-year-old college dropout, opened a small pasteurisation plant in Parma. Two decades later, the company had grown into a multinational corporation diversifying into milk, dairy, beverage, bakery, and other product lines in the 1980s, becoming listed on the Milan stock exchange in 1990, and expanding further in the 1990s. By 22 April 2002, Parmalat's share price had reached a record and the company was valued at \u20ac3.7bn, employing over 30,000 people in 30 countries. The company began to expand and had listed in its portfolio amongst other things: an expansion in the space of a decade from six countries into ownership of ParmaTour (a travel group) and Odeon TV, Parma F.C., Paulista Futebol Clube and S.E. Palmeiras. In 1997, Parmalat expanded into financial markets, financing several international acquisitions, especially in the Western Hemisphere, with debt. But by 2001, many of the new divisions were producing losses, and the company financing shifted largely to the use of derivatives, apparently at least in part with the intention of hiding the extent of its losses and debt. In February 2003, chief financial officer Fausto Tonna unexpectedly announced a new \u20ac300 million bond issue. This came as a surprise both to the markets and to the CEO, Calisto Tanzi. Tanzi forced Tonna to resign and replaced him with Alberto Ferraris. According to an interview he later gave Time magazine, Ferraris was surprised to discover that, though now CFO, he still did not have access to some of the corporate books, which were being handled by chief accounting officer Luciano Del Soldato. He began making some inquiries and began to suspect that the company's total debt was more than double that on the balance sheet.[4] The plan for a \u20ac300 million fundraising effort was dropped in September 2003 and the company's shares depreciated significantly as a result of the publicised concerns raised over transactions with mutual fund Epicurum, a Cayman-based company linked to Parmalat by November. Ferraris resigned less than a week after the public fall-out and was replaced by Del Soldato. Del Soldato resigned the next month, unable to get cash from Epicurum fund, needed to pay debts and make bond payments totalling at least \u20ac150 million. Bonlat was a subsidiary of Parmalat set up in the Cayman Islands. Bonlat's bank, Bank of America, then released a document showing \u20ac3.95 billion in Parmalat's bank account as a forgery. Tanzi resigned as chairman and CEO. Hundreds of thousands of investors lost their money and would never recover it. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi changed bankruptcy laws by decree to allow a company to seek accelerated protection from creditors, by giving extraordinary powers to a government-appointment administrator (commissario). Enrico Bondi was named commissario.[5] Calisto Tanzi was detained hours after the firm was declared officially insolvent in late December and admitted that there was a hole of \u20ac8 billion in Parmalat's accounts, but denied any cover-up. The arrest of five other executives followed. The auditors of the administration eventually determined that the debts amounted to \u20ac14.3 billion, which was almost eight times the sum originally stated. Several of the company's subsidiaries subsequently went insolvent, including its Brazilian, Argentinian and American operations and its football club in Parma. Tanzi was eventually charged with financial fraud and money laundering. Among the questionable accounting practices used by Parmalat were selling itself credit-linked notes, in effect placing a bet on its own creditworthiness to conjure up an asset out of thin air. After his arrest, Tanzi reportedly admitted during questioning at Milan's San Vittore prison that he diverted funds from Parmalat into Parmatour and elsewhere. The family football and tourism enterprises were financial disasters as well, as Tanzi attempted to rival Berlusconi by buying Odeon TV, only to sell it at a loss of about \u20ac45 million. Tanzi was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fraud relating to the collapse of the dairy group. The other seven defendants, including executives and bankers, were acquitted. Another eight defendants settled out of court in September 2008.[3] New leadership at Parmalat began investigating and suing Bank of America, Deloitte and Grant Thornton International - the bank and auditing firms that were alleged to have helped in perpetuing the fraud of earlier management at Parmalat.[6] In 2007, Deloitte settled on paying $149M to Parmalat.[7][8] Bank of America, Parmalat's bank in many Special-purpose entities, settled for  $100M payment to Parmalat in 2009. Grant Thornton International, Parmalat's auditing company, settled after repeated lawsuits for $4.4M with Parmalat.[9] The new management at Parmalat recovered about $700M in payments from the banks and auditing firms it sued for negligence and aiding in the fraud of former Parmalat leadership.[10] In 2005 Vicenzi bought from Parmalat the unprofitable bakery plant of Nusco,[11] opened in 1984 for political reasons because it was the home town of Democrazia Cristiana chieftain Ciriaco De Mita.[12] By 2011, Parmalat had grown cash to \u20ac1.5 billion.[13] Lactalis quickly purchased nearly 30\u00a0% of the company on the open market and in July 2011 succeeded in its \u20ac2.5 billion takeover offer, reaching a control of 80\u00a0% shares at \u20ac2.6 per share.[14] In 2015 revenues reached \u20ac6.42 billion and EBITDA \u20ac444.5 million. Lactalis prepared to delist Parmalat in 2016 with a buyout offer at \u20ac2.8 per share to acquire the remaining 12\u00a0%,[15] then raised to \u20ac3[16] but eventually failed due to opposition by hedge fund Amber and others. In December 2018, Lactalis was thought to have almost reached 95\u00a0% shares at an open market price of around \u20ac2.85/share and to be about to launch a new takeover and delisting offer.[17] Lactalis acquired 7\u00a0% of the shares from Amber and other shareholders which had opposed the 2016 takeover,[18] and confirmed the delisting for March 2019.[1] Lactalis moved all strategic activities to France and gradually wound down operations in Italy.[13] In 2019, the future of the historical factory in Rome was also in doubt.[1] ",

Its founder is Daniele Perazzi, and his family owns and operates it.  Perazzi shotguns are quality guns and are priced accordingly. The factory is in Botticino near Brescia, Italy. The guns are made to order and the customer can actually visit the factory to get a gun fit and select their wood. This is often called \"The Perazzi Experience\".The process of purchasing a shotgun normally begins with the specification of all the metalwork first. Custom options include the gauge of the shotgun, the blank and grade of wood for the stock and forearm, barrel length and diameter, rib height and width, the trigger group, and receiver engraving. The guns can also be engraved and there are different levels of engraving quality and also side plates available. A \"test gun\" is used to determine the correct fit and measurements for the shotgun to be made for the customer.  In the Perazzi factory there is a public viewing area of shotgun production. Customers also have the option of visiting the nearby family owned Cafe / restaurant for homemade pasta and wine while their shotgun is being made.[2] Daniele Perazzi[3] was six years old when he was introduced to firearms by his uncle. Later when he was fourteen, he was hired by a local gunsmith. Before becoming an apprentice to the gunsmith, he often ran errands around town on a bicycle. Perazzi began working on his own at the age of twenty.[4] He found his first commercial success after inventing and patenting a trigger design which he sold to other gun manufacturers.[4] At the age of twenty five in 1957, Perazzi officially established Perazzi Armi.[4] In 1960, Perazzi met Ivo Fabbri, a young automotive engineer who worked for Fiat. The two joined together to create high class, yet affordable shotguns. They were inspired by the British gun makers Boss & Co. and Woodward, who made firearms by hand with extravagant prices.[2] Perazzi and Ivo believed there was a way to create such high class firearms that would be affordable for the average Italian. The pair then began to work with Italian shooting star and gun designer, Ennio Mattarelli.[4] From this partnership the first Olympic grade Perazzi shotgun was born, which Mattarelli used to win the gold medal in Olympic trap at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics with a world record score of 198/200 targets.[5] A year later Fabbri separated from Perazzi to establish his own firearm company, Fabbri Arms. Perazzi continued to work with Mattarelli. The two focused on developing a new shotgun for Mattarelli to shoot at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. The model MX8 shotgun was born, built specifically for the conditions of shooting in Mexico City. The gun featured a higher rib and respective higher stock to reduce heat distortion along the sight plane in the hot climate. Doing so lowered to the placement of the stock on the shoulder, resulting in the recoil being directed horizontally back into the shooter, rather than vertical muzzle jump. A pistol grip was included to increase the control over traditional straight English stocks.[5] The MX8 was also one of the first guns to have interchangeable screw in chokes in the bottom barrel.[5] This feature is now found in nearly every modern shotgun. Also included was the revolutionary detachable v-springs trigger assembly. Perazzi preferred v-springs over the traditional coil trigger assembly due to their better trigger pulls.[2] The draw back of v-springs was their unreliability. When worn out they can break without warning, unlike the coil trigger assemblies they slowly wear down with age. Since the v-spring assembly was detachable, they could be changed at any time by the competitor for peace of mind.[2] This innovation along with slanted hammers reduced misfires significantly.[5] Following Daniele Perazzi's death in 2012, his son, Mauro, and his daughter, Roberta, have taken over the business.[4] 1964 Tokyo[5] 1996 Atlanta[6] 2000 Sydney[6] 2004 Athens[6] 2012 London[6] ",

It shares its ancestry with motor vehicle manufacturer Piaggio and is one of the world's oldest aircraft manufacturers.  Piaggio Aerospace designs, develops, manufactures and maintains aircraft, aero-engines and aircraft structural components. It has a subsidiary in the United States, Piaggio America, located at West Palm Beach, Florida. On December 3, 2018, Piaggio Aerospace was admitted to go under receivership after declaring itself insolvent as its restructuring plan failed, less than a year after its owner, Mubadala, injected \u20ac255 million ($308 million) and repurchased its bank debt, as the P.180 Avanti deliveries fell to four in 2018 from 30 in 2008.[1] The Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A. company was founded in Genoa in 1884, originally outfitting ocean liners and manufacturing rolling stock for the developing railway infrastructure at the turn of the century. Due to financial gains in this industry, Rinaldo Piaggio was able to build a factory in 1906 in Final Marina. Today, the site of Piaggio's facility is in Finale Ligure, where Piaggio Aero began to manufacture aircraft and aircraft engines. The 1920s served as an important time in the company's history when, Piaggio Aero brought on Giovanni Pegna and Giuseppe Gabrielli, two aeronautical engineers, to help develop Piaggio's aeronautic line. Together they created modern technical solutions for aviation, that brought forth the design and build of the world's first helicopter. Senator Rinaldo Piaggio died in 1938, at 71 years old, thus ending the Rinaldo Piaggio era. When the battles of World War II left the company's facilities in ruins, it was Rinaldo's sons Enrico, inventor of the Vespa motor scooter, and Armando, who began the rebuilding process. 1948 was the year Piaggio launched the Piaggio P.136, a twin-engine seaplane, that was operated by the Italian Air Force, when liaison transport missions were needed. Due to the increase of basic aircraft training, the German Air Force ordered 265 Piaggio P.149 units in 1953. By 1957 Piaggio created the Piaggio P.166 light transport aircraft that was marketed and produced for the military and civilian personnel worldwide. In 1960, Piaggio, under the license of the Rolls Royce Viper and started manufacturing jet engines. This move led to the expansion of Piaggio's current business. In 1966, the company separated into two separate entities, one was Vespa motor scooter and the other Piaggio Aero. Though one focused on the developments of the motor scooter and the other on aeronautical, both companies still maintain the Piaggio name. By 1998, the assets of Rinaldo Piaggio S.p.A. exchanged hands and a group of entrepreneurs headed by the Di Mase and Ferrari families and Piaggio became Piaggio Aero Industries. This acquiring of assets brought Piaggio Aero Industries back to its roots, as a designer and producer of business aircraft. In 2006 Mubadala Development Company, acquired a 35% stake Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A. Mubadala Development Company is a wholly owned investment vehicle of the Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. In 2008, the Indian multinational conglomerate the Tata Group acquired a one-third stake in Piaggio Aero Industries, becoming one of the primary shareholders alongside Piero Ferrari, the Di Mase family and Mubadala Development Company.[2] As part of the acquisition Tata gained the right to appoint three of the nine seats on the board, and one of the three seats on the management committee.[2] In 2015, Mubadla Development Company acquired 100% of the capital stock and assumed full control  after obtaining the final 1.95% of the stock from Piero Ferrari.[3] Piaggio Aero Industries has production facilities covering 120,000 square meters (1.3 million square feet) in the northwest Italian cities of Genoa Sestri and Finale Ligure, as well as a High Technology Center based in Pozzuoli, near Naples. The final aircraft assembly and flight-testing of aircraft is located at main facility in Genoa, which includes the corporate headquarters. Also located here is the Company's new JAR 145 certified service center, which offers full service and support to Piaggio P.180 Avanti customers as well as other aircraft. Piaggio Aero also operates two additional service centers, one at Rome's Ciampino Airport and the other at the Pratica di Mare Air Base. These service centers provide support services to commercial, government and military customers. Aircraft and engine component manufacturing operations, general engineering, and engine maintenance and overhaul are all undertaken at Finale Ligure. Operations include a maintenance center and two production areas, one for engines and sheet metal parts, another for major aircraft sub-assemblies and aero structures. The High Technology Center is located in the Campania region of Italy, near Naples, focuses on aero structure design and innovative systems research. It includes the Piaggio High Technology (PHT) division, a corporate research facility which focuses on innovative aeronautical technologies. The PHT division is a joint partnership between Piaggio Aero Industries, the Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA), and other European research centers. The goal is to establish the PHT as a Center of Excellence for aeronautic research and development.  This center is projected to continue the Piaggio Aero tradition of new and innovative aerospace technologies and products. Piaggio Aero is building a new modern manufacturing facility in Villanova d'Albenga, about 70 kilometers west of Genoa.  Designed around the principles of lean manufacturing technologies, this plant will allow Piaggio Aero to increase production capacity, production efficiency and optimize workflow.[4] It currently manufactures parts and performs maintenance, repair and overhaul operations on jet, turbo shaft and turboprop engines under license from Rolls-Royce and Honeywell; it also holds Long Term Agreements from other Original Equipment Manufacturers, including Pratt & Whitney, Pratt & Whitney Canada and Micro turbo, whose engines power civil and military aircraft and helicopters. In 2000, Piaggio Aero Industries signed a collaboration agreement with Rolls-Royce to join the RTM 322 turbo shaft engine program as a manufacturing partner. Currently, Piaggio Aero Industries manufactures a significant share of the RTM322 engine parts. In 2003 Piaggio Aero Industries was selected by Pratt & Whitney to supply the Low Pressure Turbine case and the bearing compartment housings for the F.135 engine, powering the F. 35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). In 2006 Piaggio Aero Industries has signed an agreement with Pratt & Whitney Canada to acquire 25% of the share capital of P&WC Turbo Engines Corp., which is in charge of the production of the PW206\u00a0\u2013 PW207 helicopter engines which fits out many helicopter models such as the Agusta A109 Power', the Eurocopter EC/135, the Bell Helicopter B427, the MD Helicopters MD900 and the Kazan Ansat. Piaggio Aero will produce engine components and will be house of the final assembly line as well as the maintenance overall al repair activities for the Pw206-207 engines. Piaggio Aero Industries has also experience in the area of infrared suppression systems (IRS) for helicopters; the Agusta A129, part of the Italian Army fleet, is currently equipped with an IRS, designed, tested and manufactured by Piaggio Aero Industries. In October 2014, Piaggio Aero changed its name to Piaggio Aerospace.[5] Piaggio Aero manufactures major aerostructures. Piaggio has been developing a new twin-engined jet, called the Piaggio P1XX, since 2006; but in August 2010 it decided to postpone production.[6] ",

SpA (Piaggio [\u02c8pjadd\u0292o]) is an Italian motor vehicle manufacturer, which produces a range of two-wheeled motor vehicles and compact commercial vehicles under seven brands: Piaggio, Vespa, Gilera, Aprilia, Moto Guzzi, Derbi, and Scarabeo. Its corporate headquarters are located in Pontedera, Italy. The company was founded by Rinaldo Piaggio in 1884, initially producing locomotives and railway carriages. Piaggio's subsidiaries employ a total of 7,053 employees and produced a total of 519,700 vehicles in 2014.[1] The manufacturer has six research-and-development centers and operates in over 50 countries.[3] In 1882, Enrico Piaggio purchased land in Sestri Ponente (Genoa) to set up a timber yard. Two years later, in 1884, his 20 year old son, Rinaldo Piaggio, founded Piaggio & C. The company initially built locomotives and railway carriages but in 1917, towards the end of World War, Rinaldo Piaggio turned to the military sector. To begin with, the company produced MAS anti-submarine motorboats, aeroplanes and seaplanes under Ansaldo, Macchi, Caproni, and Dornier licenses but later progressed to vehicles constructed according Piaggio's own drawings.[4] Between 1937 and 1939 Piaggio achieved 21 world records with its aircraft and engines built at the company's new factory in Pontedera, culminating in the four-engine Piaggio P.108 bomber. Rinaldo died in 1938, by which time Piaggio was owned by multiple shareholders within the family, along with the entrepreneur Attilio Odero. Management of the company passed to his sons Enrico and Armando.[5] By 1940 Piaggio was manufacturing trains, nautical fittings, aircraft engines, aeroplanes, trucks, trams, buses, funiculars and aluminium windows. The Pontedera plant was destroyed by Allied bombing and production activities were relocated to the Biella area. After the war, Enrico Piaggio decided to diversify the company's activities outside the aeronautical industry to address a perceived need for a modern, affordable mode of transport for the Italian mass market. The first attempt, based on a small motorcycle made for parachutists, was known as the MP5 and nicknamed the \"Paperino\" (the Italian name for Donald Duck) because of its strange shape. Ultimately Enrico Piaggio did not like it and asked Corradino D\u2019Ascanio to redesign it. D'Ascanio, an aeronautical engineer responsible for the design and construction of the first modern helicopter by Agusta, was not naturally enthusiastic about motorcycles, judging them to be uncomfortable and bulky, with wheels that were difficult to change after a puncture. When asked to design a motorcycle for Ferdinando Innocenti, D'Ascanio had come up with a step through scooter design but D'Ascanio and Innocenti disagreed over use of pressings rather than tubing so D'Ascanio brought his design to Piaggio. Innocenti would ultimately use D'Ascanio's original design for their Lambretta scooter. Piaggio asked D'Ascanio to create a simple, robust and affordable vehicle. The motorcycle had to be easy to drive for both men and women, be able to carry a passenger, and not get its driver's clothes dirty. The engineer's drawings proved a significant departure from the Paperino. With the help of Mario D'Este he prepared the first Vespa project, manufactured at Piaggio newly-rebuilt Pontedera headquarters in April 1946. Piaggio launched the Vespa (Italian for \"wasp\") and within ten years more than a million units had been produced. The Italian language gained a new word, \"vespare\", meaning to go somewhere on a Vespa.[6] Vespa thrived until 1992 when Gianni Agnelli became CEO. Agnelli was already suffering from cancer and died in 2003. In 1999 Morgan Grenfell Private Equity acquired Piaggio, but hopes for a quick sale were dashed by a failed joint venture in China.[clarification needed] In Italy, Piaggio invested 15 million euros ($19.4\u00a0million) in a new motorcycle but dropped it after building a prototype. By the end of 2002, the company had run up 577\u00a0million Euros in debt on revenues of 945\u00a0million Euros, and booked a loss of 129\u00a0million Euros. In 2003 Piaggio's debt was reduced a 100 million Euro investment made by IMMSI, a holding company of the Colaninno family. 150\u00a0million shares were also converted by creditor banks. Reflecting on his investment, Roberto Colaninno said, \"A lot of people told me I was crazy. Piaggio wasn't dying. It just needed to be treated better.\"[7]\" Colannino became the new chairman of Piaggio, while Dr. Rocco Sabelli becoming the managing director. Sabelli redesigned the production line according to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line. Contrary to expectations, Mr. Colaninno did not fire a single worker \u2013 a move which helped seduce the company's skeptical unions. \"Everyone in a company is part of the value chain,\" said Colaninno. All bonuses for blue-collar workers and management were based on the same criteria: profit margins and customer satisfaction. Air conditioning was installed in the factory for the first time, increasing productivity. He also gave the company's engineers, who had been idled by the company's financial crisis, deadlines for projects. They rolled out two world firsts in 2004: a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a sophisticated tilting scooter with two wheels in front and one in back to grip the road better. One of Piaggio's problems Mr. Colaninno couldn't fix from the inside was its scale. Even though Piaggio was the European market leader, it was dwarfed by rivals Honda and Yamaha. A year after restoring Piaggio's health, Colaninno directed Piaggio's takeover of the Italian scooter and motorcycle manufacturer Aprilia, and with it the Aprilia-owned Moto Guzzi, a storied Italian manufacturer of motorcycles. In 2006, Piaggio floated on the Milan Stock Exchange, becoming a public company. In 1956, with production of the millionth Vespa scooter, Italy had its first mass-produced motorised vehicle. Taking advantage of increased cash flow thanks to the success of the Vespa, Piaggio developed other products, including the 1957 Vespa 400, a compact passenger car. In 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the Agnelli family, the owners of car maker Fiat SpA. By 1960 Vespa had produced and sold 4 million units worldwide.[8] In 1964 the aeronautical and motorcycle divisions of Piaggio split to become two independent companies as a result of the wide ownership by Fiat in Italian industry.[clarification needed] The aeronautical division was named IAM Rinaldo Piaggio. The aircraft company Piaggio Aero was controlled by the family of Piero Ferrari, who still hold 10% of Ferrari. In 1969 Piaggio purchased the motorcycle company Gilera, one of the oldest European motorcycle manufacturers (founded in 1909), famous for its sporting achievements and world titles in the Motorcycle World Championship.[9] In 1971 a steering wheel was added to the Piaggio Ape, a model first produced in 1948, culminating in the Ape Car. Four years later, in 1975, the company made the first prototype of an electric Ape.[10] In 1988 the Vespa reached the milestone of 10 million units produced.[11] In 1996, on the fiftieth anniversary of the first model, Vespa passed 15 million units produced and the new 4-stroke Vespa ET, the first completely new Vespa for 18 years, was launched.[12] Piaggio was still in poor financial health but its brand recognition remained strong, boosted by the appearance of the ET4 in several Hollywood films. In 1999, in Baramati, production began on a three-wheeler Ape for the Indian domestic market.[13] In 2000 Piaggio and Vespa returned to the United States with the opening of the first Vespa Boutique in Los Angeles. In that same year the Piaggio Historical Museum was inaugurated in Pontedera. The museum showcases the Piaggio Historical Archive, one of the most comprehensive company archives on the industrial history of Italy.[14] In 2001 the Piaggio Group acquired Derbi-Nacional Motor SA,[15] an historical Spanish brand founded in 1922 that had won 18 world titles and was a continental leader in the small displacement motorbike segment. In the same year Gilera returned to the Motorcycle World Championship and immediately won the world title in the 125 category with Manuel Poggiali.[16] In 2004, at the end of December, the final contract for the acquisition of the Aprilia-Moto Guzzi Group was signed. The most important European two-wheeler group is born.[17] In 2007 Piaggio Group officially arrives in Vietnam. The Vinh Puch plant includes R&D, welding and painting activities, as well as final assembly of the scooters, with warehouse, testing, quality control and office areas.[18] In 2009 the Piaggio Mp3 Hybrid makes its debut on the market which was first hybrid scooter in the world, integrating the conventional low-environmental-impact internal combustion engine with a zero-emission electric motor and combining the advantages of the two power trains.[19] In Baramati (State of Maharashtra), in 2012, the Piaggio Group's new plant for the production of Vespa's for the local market was opened.[20] In 2013 the PADC \u2013 Piaggio Advanced Design Center opened in Pasadena (California, United States).[21] The Vespa 946 was also launched this year, along with the new Vespa Primavera, the latest evolution of the \"small body\" family. In 2013 Vespa's worldwide sales numbered almost 190,000 units; in 2004 the figure stood at 58,000. In ten years of continuous progression over 1.3\u00a0million new Vespas have reached the streets of the world. Since 1946 over 18 million Vespas have been produced and sold.[22] In September 2017 Foton and Piaggio agreed to form a joint venture to develop and produce light commercial vehicle.[23] Based on Foton chassis the new vehicle was sold by Piaggio Commercial Vehicle division in Europe and in all markets around the world but not in China. The vehicle is intended to be a successor of the Piaggio Porter and production is planned to start in mid-2019 in Pontedera (Italy) with all components produced by Foton in China.[24] Piaggio's \"cultural project\" promotes the reconstruction and enhancement of the company's heritage and is composed by three initiatives:  the Piaggio Foundation, the Historical Archives and the Piaggio Museum. In 2003 the Museum and Archives were recognised as the Best Corporate Museum and Archive by winning the Italian prize \"Premio Impresa e Cultura\".[25] In 2016, under the patronage of the Italian Ministry of Culture, Piaggio received the Corporate Art Award from pptArt for its Corporate Museum.[26] The new plug-in hybrid version of the Piaggio MP3 will be equipped with a 125\u00a0cc petrol engine and electric motor, which offers about 141\u00a0mpg\u2011US (1.67\u00a0L/100\u00a0km; 169\u00a0mpg\u2011imp) and travels 13 miles (21\u00a0km) using battery power alone. This machine could be out in 2009.[27] Piaggio/Vespa are also developing hybrid electric scooters. There are two models in the works, based on the popular Vespa LX 50 and the beefier Piaggio X8 125.[28] ",

            "text": "Cicli Pinarello S.p.A. is an Italian bicycle manufacturer based in Treviso, Italy. Founded in 1952, it supplies mostly handmade bicycles for the road, track and cyclo-cross. The company also produces bicycles under the Opera brand name, and has an in-house component brand \u2013 MOST. In December 2016, the company was acquired by L Catterton, a private equity group associated with LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, better known as LVMH.[1] Giovanni Pinarello was born in Catena di Villorba, Italy in 1922. He was the eighth of 12 brothers. At the age of 15, Giovanni began making bicycles at the factory of Paglianti. After a successful amateur career he turned professional in 1947, aged 25.[2][3][4][5] Pinarello died on 4 September 2014.[6] The Pinarello Montello SLX was a landmark model for Pinarello as this was the frame with which Pinarello achieved their first major pro victories. This model frame was one of the most responsive of the mid to late 1980s as shown by wins in events such as the 1984 Summer Olympics Road Race, Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, the Giro d'Italia and stages of the Tour de France.[7] The Montello had a brake cable through the top tube, chrome sloping front fork and chrome on the drive side chain stay; later models had the full rear triangle chromed.  The Montello SLX was in red, blue and Spumoni.[8]  Pinarellos from the mid-1980s often have the decals restored by collectors as factory-applied decals where prone to flakeing off.[9] The Montello was fabricated from Columbus SLX butted tubing with rifling down the inside center. The bottom bracket was investment cast with the Pinarello logo and the dropouts were by Campagnolo. Braze-ons for down-tube shifters, front derailleur and two water bottles were provided. The GPT logo (for Giovanni Pinarello, Treviso) appeared in many locations. The Pinarello Treviso was the second-in-line model under the Montello SLX in the mid-to-late '80's.  Built with Columbus SL tubing, it featured a painted fork and seat stays, with chromed chain stays. This model also featured the sloping fork crown.  On the road it is easily distinguished from the Montello by the single chrome chain stay. However, some older models of the Treviso (1981) did not have the chrome chain stay. After the Montello SLX, Pinarello departed from his standard production design with parallel seat and head tube angles and created the Gavia.  This provided more saddle setback than the Montello or other Pinarello designs. Greg LeMond, the winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989 and 1990,[10] promoted designs that pushed the saddle further back.[11]  The Gavia was constructed of Columbus TSX tubing.  This model was available in red, blue with pearl white panels and pearl white with fluorescent splatter.[8] The Pinarello Paris in the mid-1990s was a 7005 series aluminium bike with an aluminium fork later replaced by the aria carbon fork. It was upon this frame that Jan Ullrich and Bjarne Riis won the Tour de France. Winner of the 2007 Editor's Choice award for a road racing bicycle from Bicycling Magazine, the Pinarello Paris FP is the premier monocoque, high modulus, unidirectional carbon fiber frame. In 2009, the FP6 replaced the Paris FP and F4:13.  The monocoque frame uses the same mold as the Paris FP, but with different carbon fiber (30HM3K). Pinarello has been slow to jump aboard the all-carbon juggernaut, preferring to concentrate on its highly regarded magnesium-frame technology as showcased in the Dogma series of bikes. But the attraction and momentum of carbon is unavoidable, and while the all-carbon F4:13 hasn't displaced the Dogma at the top of Pinarello's line-up, it is clearly a serious and purposeful attempt to use the material's properties to best advantage, starting with one-piece main frame construction to exploit carbon's stiffness and low weight. The Pinarello FP Uno was the current base model bicycle built by Pinarello evolving from its predecessor, the FP1. The FP Uno features hydroformed asymmetric 6061 T6 triple butted aluminium tubing. The next superior model is the Pinarello FP Due. Like the FP Uno, this has evolved from its predecessor, the FP2. The frame is constructed from 24HM12K carbon fibre. The Pinarello FP Quattro is built from 30HM12K carbon fibre and features carbon asymmetric stays with Onda carbon forks. The Quattro also utilises the new iCR internal cable routing system, which has been developed in house, by Pinarello. The Pinarello Neor replaced the FP Uno as Pinarellos base road bike model, featuring the same hydroformed aluminum frame as the FP Uno, but now boasts a carbon fibre rear triangle as well as ONDA carbon front forks.[12] The Pinarello FPTEAM Carbon is constructed from 24HM12K uni-directional carbon fibre and features both tapered 1 \"1/8 1\" 1/4 ONDA front forks and ONDA rear triangles.[13] The Pinarello Rahza is a full 24HM12K carbon fibre frame, featuring an asymmetrical monocoque design which improved frame rigidity. The frame also features ONDA forks and rear stays as well as the BB30 bottom bracket.[14] The Pinarello Marvel is an entirely new asymmetry frame originating from the Pinarello Paris (constructed from Torayca 50HM1.5 carbon fibre) made from 30HM12K carbon. Rigidity of the frame is further improved by the usage of a tapered headset (1\" 1/8 - 1\" 1/2) as well as featuring internal cable routing. Pinarello say that the Marvel is \"top level bike and already UCI approved for use in official competitions.\" The Marvel also makes full use of the Think2 system allowing the usage of both electronic and mechanical groupsets. Other new features include the new ONDA2V front fork and a new aerodynamic downtube.[15] For 2016 Pinarello updated their product line starting with new mid-level bikes up to models just below the Dogma Series. All GAN Series models take styling and design cues from the Dogma F8. The entry level GAN stems directly from the design efforts of the Dogma F8, whilst having a less 'extreme' style which aids riding comfort. The GAN Disk variant contains the same features as the GAN but also includes disk brakes, both models are manufactured from T600 carbon fibre.[16] The GAN S features an all T700 carbon fibre frame, whilst still maintaining design features akin to the F8.[17] The top of the class model is the GAN RS which features a higher strength T900 Toray carbon.[18] The Pinarello Dogma was the first of the current top line of bicycle made by the company and was the first bicycle of a 'new generation' of frames, it is the successor to the Pinarello Prince range and was released for sale to the public in 2010. The frames focus around a completely asymmetric design made entirely of 60HM1K carbon fibre, with the right hand side of the Dogma frame is different in shape and section to that of the left side, thus providing increased rigidity against forces placed upon the frame by the action of pedalling.[19] In 2011 the successor the Dogma, the Pinarello Dogma 2 was revealed at the 2011 Tour de France. The Dogma 2 featured aerodynamic improvements which increased the efficiency of the frame.[20] Bradley Wiggins rode the Dogma 2 to victory in the 2012 Tour de France. In 2012, mountain bike trials rider, Martyn Ashton, created a video in which he performed several tricks and stunts on a Dogma 2. The video, entitled \"Road Bike Party\", went viral, gaining over half a million views in one day, and it currently has over eight million views on YouTube. The Pinarello Dogma K features Pinarellos 'Century Ride' geometry and uses frame design that provides increased comfort without compromising the overall performance. As with other modern Pinarellos, the frame incorporates an asymmetric design which offsets the asymmetric forces created during the pedalling. The Dogma K and the Dogma frame differ from each other in the angle of the seat tube, brought back to increase shock absorption, and reduced head tube angle as well as slightly longer chain stays to increase comfort. Furthermore, a longer wheelbase makes for a frame that is less rigid vertically, improving shock absorption. The Pinarello ROKH is a frame that was made in an effort to offer the excellent performance of the DOGMA K to a wider group of cyclists. The ROKH's geometry is similar in shape and construction but with an even longer wheel base to add even more vertical compliance than the Dogma K. The Dogma K Hydro mirrors the new model variation seen with the Dogma 65.1, whereby hydraulic disc brakes have now been added. The Hydro features new ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disc) forks, as well as new chainstays accommodating the RAD braking system seen on both the DOGMA XC and Dogma 65.1 Hydro.[21] The 2013 generation of the Dogma bicycle is the Dogma 65.1 Think2. When compared to the Dogma2, the Think2 features stronger and more rigid carbon fibre, 65HM1K, yielding a more reactive frame. Moreover, the Think2 has been built with the new electronic shifting group sets in mind, and thus has internal cable routing for both Shimano and Campagnolo systems.[22] The 2014 Dogma 65.1 Hydro variant of the Dogma is virtually the same as the 2013 Think2 model, made from Torayca 65Ton HM 1K carbon fibre with \"Nanoalloy technology\". The Hydro however, accommodates hydraulic disc brakes and features a new front fork developed from the previous ONDA2 fork, called the ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disk). The frame also features new chainstays which accommodate the new RAD braking system, derived from the development of the Dogma XC.[23] Chris Froome rode the Dogma 65.1 Think2 to victory in the 2013 Tour de France. In May 2014 the Pinarello Dogma F8 was revealed as part of Pinarellos 2015 product launch, with the name deriving from this particular Dogma model being the 8th generation.[24] The new bike was developed in conjunction with Team Sky sponsor and car manufacturer Jaguar and takes design cues (such as the front fork shape) from the Bolide time trial bike. Research advancements have led to claimed aerodynamic gains, with the F8 being 26.1% more aerodynamic than the Dogma 65.1, 6.4% more aerodynamic when including the bike rider and the frameset alone being 40% more aerodynamically efficient than the predecessor.[25] The bike is expected to debut at the 2014 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. In April 2015, just days ahead of the Tour of Flanders Pinarello, along with Jaguar-Land Rover and Team Ineos, unveiled the Dogma K8-S \u2013 a replacement for the cobble-focused Dogma K. The most striking aspect of the new bike is the rear suspension system, dubbed the Dogma Suspension System, which can provide up to 10mm of travel; this however, is not the first time road bikes have been fitted with suspension.[26] The bike was designed in conjunction with Jaguar[27] and features the aerodynamic fork from the Dogma F8, which in conjunction with the suspension system is claimed to reduce vibrations by 50%, with data from Jaguar-Land Rover showing an increase in speed of 8% and a reduction in energy usage of 10%.[28][29] A version of the bike will also be made which does not have the suspension system built in - the Dogma K8.[30] In May 2015, the company launched the Dogma F8 Disk in preparation for the UCI's review on the use of disk brakes in road competitions. The bike is essentially the same as the standard F8 in terms of performance and characteristics.[31][32] In December 2015, the company launched a limited edition variant of the F8, the Dogma F8w, which uses the wireless SRAM RED eTap groupset.[33][34][35] In 2016, just before the 2016 Tour de France the company launched the Dogma F8 Xlight.[36] In January 2017, the company revealed its new flagship bike, the Dogma F10. Unlike in previous years where Pinarello have timed their new product reveals with the Giro d'Italia, the F10 was revealed before the start of the 2017 season. The Team Ineos team-bikes will be equipped with Shimanos newest 9150 Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, whilst Pinarello claim the F10 is 6.3% lighter and 7% stiffer than its predecessor (still composed of Torayca T1100 1K carbon), whilst a 53\u00a0cm unpainted frame has a claimed weight of only 820g. The F10 also has a 12.6% claimed aerodynamic advantage over the F8, coming in part from the 'concave' back shaped aerofoils (also found on the second version of the Bolide time trial bike). The F10 also has a number of aerodynamic devices which have been taken from other models, the aforementioned Bolide, as well as Bradley Wiggins' hour record bike.[37] Only hours after its release, Taiwanese bike manufacturer - Velocite -  claimed that new F10 and the second version of the Bolide infringe three of its patents.[38] The F10 will also be available to the public immediately. During the 2017 Giro d'Italia a number of Team Sky riders tested the Dogma F10 X-Light - a lightweight version of the F10 - in readiness for the 2017 Tour de France. Pinarello claim an unpainted X-Light weighs in at 760g for a 53 cm sized frame.[39] In mid-July the company announced the Dogma F10 Disc would be produced for sale.[40] A day later the company revealed the Dogma K10, taking aerodynamic and visual cues from the F10 forebearer[41] and the electronically-controlled suspension variant, the Dogma K10S Disk.[42] In May 2019, the company revealed the successor to the Dogma F10, the Dogma F12 which is launched alongside Team Ineos. The Pinarello Montello FP8 was a time trial bicycle manufactured by Pinarello prior to the introduction of the Graal. It was made with aerospace grade carbon fibre composite. The 50HM3K carbon fibre creates an ultra stiff and light ride. The Pinarello Graal is a time trial frame manufactured by Pinarello. The Graal was designed using CFD techniques, maximizing the efficiency of the bicycle. The frame is available in both an electronic version and mechanical version, with the electronic version featuring an internally mounted battery.[43] The Pinarello Bolide was released on 2 May 2013[44] with gains of a 15% reduction in aerodynamic drag and 5% reduction in weight over the Graal. Team Sky's 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins used the new bike at the 2013 Giro d'Italia. The Bolide has been in development for over year with both Pinarello lab technicians and Team Sky working on the bike. The Bolide uses aeroplane wing-shaped tubular sections in conjunction with a 'concave back' on the seat tube. This allows the rear wheel and frame to be closer together. In addition, the brakes are shielded behind leading small fairings and the frame utilizes integrated cabling to further minimize drag.[44] On 21 June 2013 Pinarello released their second (in-house developed) high end time trial frame, called the Pinarello Sibilo.[45] The Sibilo will debut at the 2013 Tour de France with Alejandro Valverde of Movistar Team.[45] Early impressions are that the Sibilo shares some common features with the Bolide, such as; airfoil tubing, track style rear dropouts and a 'concave back'. Moreover, the Sibilo carries some aerodynamic refinements over the Bolide, for example, the front brake is further integrated into the forks and the rear brake has been moved towards the chainstays. These modifications remove the need for the brake fairings which are seen on the Bolide. The Sibilo is constructed from the same Torayca 65HM1K carbon as the Bolide, with internal cable routing for extra aerodynamic benefit. The Sibilo utilizes the stiff BB86 bottom bracket and can also accommodate both mechanical groupsets such as the Shimano Dura-Ace and Campagnolo Super Record sets, as well as their electronic variants (Dura-Ace Di2 and Campagnolo EPS).[45] The Pinarello Xirion is designed specifically for triathletes by utilizing favorable frame geometry and is made from 24HM Unidirectional carbon fibre. The Xirion is sold as a complete bicycle fitted with Vision cycling components.[46] In light of Bradley Wiggins' hour record attempt, Pinarello collaborated with Jaguar to produce the Bolide HR. The HR variant has aero-optimised front forks, seat stays and dropouts. The bike also features printed titanium bars.[47] In 2015, the endurance part of the Italian national cycling team received Bolide HR bikes. At the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Filippo Ganna rode his Bolide HR to victory in the Individual Pursuit.[48] In May 2016, three years after its initial introduction, the Pinarello Bolide TT[49] was released exclusively to Team Sky.[50] The first race-ready model of the bike will be given to Mikel Landa for use on the Stage 9 time trial at the 2016 Giro d'Italia.[51][52] The Pinarello Dogma XC 9.9 features the unique-to-Pinarello divided rear triangle and is made from 60HM1K Torayca carbon fibre \"Nanoalloy\" technology. Torayca Nanoalloy technology has nano-particles embedded within the carbon fibre weave that Pinarello say explode upon impact, preventing the fiber from breaking or de-laminating. Pinarello calls the unique seat stay design \"ONDA XC Asymmetric Twin Arms\" Traditional frames have rear stays directly connected to the toptube, meaning that vibrations originating from the rear triangle are directly transferred all the way up to the handlebars. Therefore, Pinarello developed a system which divided the two main rear triangles, moving one higher than the other. These stays attach to the seat tube above the top tube, at separate points from one another, and they also serve as the seatpost clamp. This system has reduced the amount of shock felt from the rear, thus improving bike handling and stability. In order to protect the down tube from the front fork, whilst still keeping a geometrically lower down tube, Pinarello developed \"ForkStopper\" technology. The frame features internal cable routing for both Shimano and SRAM. The XC 9.9 was revealed at Granfondo La Pina in Treviso, Italy on 15 July 2012.[53] The Pinarello Dogma XC 7.7 features the same unique-to-Pinarello divided rear triangle and is made from 60HM1K Torayca carbon fibre.[54] The Pinarello Dogma XM 9.9 represents Pinarellos first venture back into Mountain biking since the Pinarello FV1, they claim the XM 9.9, constructed from 65HM3K carbon fibre, is as stiff as a roadbike. This claim is made through the usage of the new \"ONDA Curve Asymmetric\" rear quadrilateral, which is firm on flat ground and only works on uneven ground. Pinarello say that their system has only 5 points of flex as well as a monocoque design allow for this set of unique properties.[55] Originally, all Pinarello frames were steel.  Pinarello used Columbus tubing for most of the 1980s but with tubing by Oria in the lower models in 1989. The first non-Italian tube was Tange Prestige for the US-based Levis Cycling team headed by Michael Fatka and ridden by Andrew Hampsten, Steve Tilford, Roy Knickmann, Thurlow Rogers in the mid-1980s.[56]  Throughout the 1990s until 2004, Pinarello produced frames from conventional steel tubing using lugs, oversize tubing, oversize aluminium with TIG welded joints, magnesium and frames of carbon fiber and other materials. In 2005, Pinarello produced its first all-carbon fibre frame, the F4:13.[57] Miguel Indurain riding a Pinarello in 1996 Bradley Wiggins on his special yellow edition Pinarello Graal at the 2012 Tour de France Pinarello Bolide ridden by Chris Froome at the 2013 Tour de France Bradley Wiggins on his British-national championship themed Bolide (prior to his 2014 World championships win) Dogma 65.1 equipped with Campagnolo Record EPS Dogma 65.1 equipped with disc brakes Bradley Wiggins on his way to breaking the Hour Record in 2015 on a modified Bolide Pinarello has sponsored professional teams since 1960. Teams include Team Telekom, Banesto, Caisse d'Epargne, Fassa Bortolo, Team Sky,[5] Movistar Team, British Cycling and British UCI Continental team Velosure-Giordana Racing Team.

            "text": "Pininfarina S.p.A. (short for Carrozzeria Pininfarina) is an Italian car design firm and coachbuilder, with headquarters in Cambiano, (Metropolitan City of Turin), Italy.  It was founded by Battista \"Pinin\" Farina in 1930. On 14 December 2015, Mahindra Group acquired Pininfarina S.p.A. for about \u20ac168 million.[2] Pininfarina is employed by a wide variety of automobile manufacturers to design vehicles.  These firms have included long-established customers such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Fiat, GM, Lancia, and Maserati, to emerging companies in the Asian market with Chinese manufactures like AviChina, Chery, Changfeng, Brilliance, and JAC and VinFast in Vietnam and Korean manufacturers Daewoo and Hyundai. Since the 1980s Pininfarina has also designed high-speed trains, buses, trams, rolling stocks, automated light rail cars, people movers, yachts, airplanes, and private jets. With the 1986 creation of \"Pininfarina Extra\" it has consulted on industrial design, interior design, architecture, and graphic design. Pininfarina was run by Battista's son Sergio Pininfarina until 2001, then his grandson Andrea Pininfarina until his death in 2008. After Andrea's death, his younger brother Paolo Pininfarina was appointed as CEO.[3] At its height in 2006 the Pininfarina Group employed 2,768 with subsidiary company offices throughout Europe, as well as in Morocco and the United States. As of 2012 with the end of series automotive production, employment has shrunk to 821. Pininfarina is registered and publicly traded on the Borsa Italiana (Milan Stock Exchange). When automobile designer and builder Battista \"Pinin\" Farina broke away from his brother's coach building firm, Stabilimenti Farina, in 1928, he founded \"Carrozzeria Pinin Farina\" with financial help from his wife's family and Vincenzo Lancia. That first year the firm employed eighteen and built 50 automobile bodies.[4] On 22 May 1930 papers were filed to become a corporation, Societ\u00e0 anonima Carrozzeria Pinin Farina  headquartered in Turin, Italy, at 107 Corso Trapani.[5][6] During the 1930s, the company built bodies for Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Isotta Fraschini, Hispano-Suiza, Fiat, Cadillac, and Rolls-Royce.[7] With its close relationship with Lancia, the pioneer of the monocoque in automobile design, Farina became the first coachbuilder to build bodies for the new technique also known as unibody construction. This development happened in the mid-1930s when others saw the frameless construction as the end of the independent coachbuilder.[8] In 1939, World War II ended automobile production, but the company had 400 employees building 150 bodies a month. The war effort against the Allies brought work making ambulances and searchlight carriages.[4] The Pinin Farina factory was destroyed by Allied bombers ending the firm's operations.[9] After the war, Italy was banned from the 1946 Paris Motor Show. The Paris show was attended by 809,000 visitors (twice the pre-war figure), queues stretched from the main gate all the way to the Seine.[10] Pinin Farina and his son Sergio, determined to defy the ban, drove two of their cars (an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 S and a Lancia Aprilia cabriolet) from Turin to Paris, and found a place at the entrance to the exhibition to display the two new creations. The managers of the Grand Palais said of the display, \"the devil Pinin Farina\", but to the press and the public it was the successful \"Turin coachbuilder's anti-salon\".[11] At the end of 1945 the  Cisitalia 202 Coup\u00e9 was designed. An elegantly proportioned design with a low hood, it is the car that usually is given credit for establishing Pinin Farina's reputation.[12] The Pinin Farina design was honored in the Museum of Modern Art's landmark presentation \"Eight Automobiles\" in 1951.[13] A total of 170 Coup\u00e9s were produced by Pinin Farina. The publicity of the Museum of Modern Art exhibit brought Pinin Farina to the attention of Nash-Kelvinator managers.[4] The subsequent cooperation with Nash Motors resulted in high-volume production of Pinin Farina designs and provided a major entry into the United States market. In 1952, Farina visited the U.S. for the unveiling of his design for the Nash Ambassador and Statesman lines, which, although they did carry some details of Pinin Farina's design, were largely designed by Nash's then-new in-house styling staff when the original Farina-designed model proved unsuited to American tastes, exhibiting a popular 1950s appearance called \"ponton\". The Nash-Healey sports car body was, however, completely designed and assembled in limited numbers from 1952 to 1954 at Pinin Farina's Turin facilities. Nash heavily advertised its link to the famous Italian designer, much as Studebaker promoted its longtime association with Raymond Loewy. As a result of Nash's million advertising campaign, Pinin Farina became well known in the U.S.[4] Pinin Farina also built the bodies for the limited-series Cadillac Eldorado Brougham for General Motors in 1959 and 1960, assembled them and sent them back to the U.S. There were 99 Broughams built in 1959 and 101 in 1960. A similar arrangement was repeated in the late 1980s when Pininfarina designed (and partially assembled) the Cadillac Allant\u00e9 at the San Giusto Canavese factory. The car bodies were assembled and painted in Italy before being flown from the Turin International Airport to Detroit for final vehicle assembly. It started in 1951 with a meeting at a restaurant in Tortona, a small town halfway between Turin and Modena. This neutral territory was chosen because neither Farina nor Enzo Ferrari wanted to meet at the other's headquarters. Pinin\u2019s son, Sergio Pininfarina recalled, \"It is not difficult to imagine how I felt that afternoon when my father, without taking his eyes off the road for one moment told me his decision as we drove back to Turin: \"From now on you'll be looking after Ferrari, from A to Z. Design, engineering, technology, construction\u2014the lot!\"\u2014I was over the moon with happiness.\" \"[14] Since that meeting the only road-going production Ferraris not designed by Pininfarina are the 1973 Dino 308 GT4 and 2013's LaFerrari.[15] Their relationship was so close that Pininfarina became a partner of Ferrari in \"Scuderia Ferrari SpA SEFAC\", the organization that ran Ferrari's race team from 1961\u20131989,[16] Pinin was a vice president of Ferrari,[17] and Sergio later sat on Ferrari's board of directors.[18] Ferrari does not sell new cars by Pininfarina in 2018. The last penned by Pininfarina was the Ferrari F12berlinetta which was produced 2012\u201317. In 1954 to 1955 Pinin Farina purchased land in Grugliasco, outside of Turin, for a new factory. \"The factory in no way would look like the one of Corso Trapani. It would be a car no longer on my measurements but on those of my children, built looking like them; I had this in mind and wanted it,\" said Farina. Around the same time, Alfa Romeo accepted Pininfarina's design over Bertone for the new Giulietta Spider. The Alfa was the first vehicle that Pinin Farina produced in large numbers, in fact Alfa Romeo chose Pinin Farina to produce the Spider in large part because they felt confident that they could produce 20 cars a day for a run of 1,000 bodies. The Spider was a huge success for Alfa Romeo and Pinin Farina. Max Hoffman the importer for the United States said he could sell as many as they could make. In 1956, the first year of production, they produced 1025 units which then expanded to over 4,000 in 1959 the first full year of the new Grugliasco factory.[19]  Starting with the planning for the new plant in Grugliasco in 1956, Pinin started to groom his replacements\u2013Sergio his son and Renzo Carli his son-in-law. To his heirs apparent, Pinin said of the Corso Trapani facility \"This old plant has reached the limits of its growth. It has no room for expansion and is far from being up to date. If I were alone I'd leave it as it is. But I want you to decide which way to go\u2013to stay as we are or to enlarge. Either way is fine with me. It's your decision to make and I don't want to know what it is. I'm finished and it's your time to take over. The future is absolutely up to you.\"[8] In 1958, upon leaving for a world tour Pinin added \"In my family we inherit our legacies from live people\u2013not from the dead.\"[8][20] In 1961 at the age of 68, \u201cPinin\u201d Farina formally turned his firm over to his son Sergio and his son-in-law, Renzo Carli, it was the same year that the President of Italy formally authorized the change of Farina\u2019s last name to Pininfarina and the business took on the same name. Pininfarina was run by Battista's grandson Andrea Pininfarina from 2001 until his death in 2008. Andrea's younger brother Paolo Pininfarina was then appointed as successor.[3] Starting in the mid-1960s, Pininfarina started to make investments in the science of automotive design, a strategy to differentiate itself from the other Italian coachbuilders. In 1966, Pininfarina opened the Studies and Research Centre (Studi e Ricerche) in Grugliasco. The research centre occupied 8,000 sq. metres (2 acres) and employed 180 technicians capable of producing 25 prototypes a year.[21] The Calculation and Design Centre was set up in 1967, the first step in a process of technological evolution which, during the 1970s, would take Pininfarina into the lead in automated bodywork design.[22] Then in 1972 construction of a full-sized wind tunnel was completed. The project was started in 1966. When it opened, it not only was the first wind tunnel with the ability to test full-sized cars in Italy, but also one of the first in the world with this ability.[22] To put this foresight in perspective, GM's full-sized wind tunnel didn't open until 1980.[23] The 1980s started a period of expansion for Pininfarina. In 1982, the company opened \u201cPininfarina Studi e Ricerche\" in Cambiano. It was separate from the factory and wind tunnel in Grugliasco, to keep design and research activities independent from manufacturing. On 14 October 2002, Pininfarina inaugurated a new engineering centre. The new facility, which was built at the Cambiano campus, to give greater visibility and independence to the engineering operations. In 1983, Pininfarina reached an agreement with General Motors to design and build the Cadillac Allant\u00e9. The Allant\u00e9 project led to the building of the San Giorgio factory in 1985.[24] In 1996, Mitsubishi entered into talks for Pininfarina build their new compact SUV, the Pajero, in Italy. While Mitsubishi recognized Pininfarina's expertise in design and engineering, the reason for choosing them was that manufacturing costs were half of those in Germany.[25] After entering into an agreement in 1996, Pininfarina purchased an industrial site at Bairo Canavese near Turin, Italy. in April 1997, Bairo Canavese was dedicated to the production of the new Mitsubishi Pajero Pinin. Pininfarina Sverige AB in Uddevalla, Sweden, was established in 2003 as a joint venture (JV) between Volvo Cars and Pininfarina to produce a new Volvo convertible that will be sold in Europe and the United States. The JV is owned 60% by Pininfarina and 40% by Volvo.[26]  The C70 model designed by Volvo's John Kinsey\u2014was launched on 13 April 2006, sharing the Volvo P1 platform used in the S40. In April 2008, after three years of serious losses totaling 115 million euros at the end of 2007,[27] Pininfarina made the first of several moves to raise capital and restructure its enormous debt: Pininfarina announced Piero Ferrari, Alberto Bombassei (chairman of Brembo), and the Marsiaj family (founders of the Sabelt seatbelt company), will join with Vincent Bollor\u00e9, a French financier, and Ratan Tata, head of India's Tata Group conglomerate, who already announced their plans to invest. The five would together invest million. Funding would come through the sale of stock to other investors. The Pininfarina family was willing to reduce its share from 55% to 30%, which would still be enough to secure a controlling interest.[28] On 31 December 2008, Pininfarina announced a debt restructuring that would require the family to sell its stake in the company. The agreement was made after Pininfarina's value dropped 67 per cent during 2008, and it then had a market capitalization of about \u20ac36 million. It had total debts of \u20ac598 million at the end of November. Of that amount, \u20ac555 million was the subject of the debt restructuring agreement that was agreed on with a consortium of banks.[29] Pincar, Pininfarina's family holding company, announced it has hired investment bank Leonardo & Co. to find a buyer for its 50.6% stake in Pininfarina per the debt restructuring agreement reached in December.[30] Pininfarina released a statement saying that it is still gathering \"possible offers from potential buyers,\" adding it would release more information when it was appropriate. Company sources added, the family will not sell its entire 50.7% stake but that Pincar would no longer be a majority shareholder.[31][failed verification] An agreement with creditor banks including Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Mediobanca and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena to restructure net debt of 76 million euros is on track and will be reached in the coming months, said three sources close to the situation. \"The debt situation is stable and the talks are not contentious, so there is no hurry,\" said one of the sources, speaking on condition anonymity. \"The agreement will fix the capital structure for the foreseeable future.\" When finalised, the debt accord will give control of the family's 77\u00a0% stake to its creditor banks, ending the Pininfarina family's ownership. The deal will close a chapter that began in 2008 when the banks swapped 180 million euros in debt in exchange for a promise of proceeds from a future sale of part of the Pininfarina's family stake. But no takers materialised. Potential buyers were not willing to acquire a design company when they can easily contract its services, said one of the people familiar with the situation.[32] In a statement released on 15 February, the Cambiano-based company, which owes over million to a number of Italian banks, said its debt repayment date has been extended to 2018, from 2015. The agreement, which will be signed in the next few weeks, will also see the company take advantage of interest rates \u201csignificantly lower than [current] market rates\u201d. With the new debt restructuring deal with its creditors Pininfarina will remain under the control of the Pininfarina family.[33] Automotive News reported Pininfarina projects will be profitable in 2012, thanks in part to debt restructuring. The Italian design studio hasn't be in profit in eight years, but signed a deal in April to restructure million in debt. The move effectively stretched the studio's repayment deadline from 2015 to 2018. At the same time, Pininfarina announced it will likely see an operating loss this year, but a one-time gain of million will result in the net profit. The preceding year, the company lost million in the first quarter, though that figure has dropped to just under million during Q1 2012. Pininfarina also saw its net revenue increase by million.[34] Pininfarina in the black for first time since 2004 Italian design house Pininfarina predicted last May that it would face an operating loss for 2012 but still come out with a net profit. Both predictions came true: the company is reporting an operating loss of 8.2 million euros and a net profit of 32.9 million euros. According to Reuters, the good news came because of a debt restructuring arranged the preceding year that gave the company three more years to repay its million in debt, and a one-time gain of approximately 45 million euros. It is the company's first profit since 2004.[35] Mahindra Group, owner of Indian automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra agreed to buy Italian car designer Pininfarina SpA in a deal worth about 168 million euros.[2] Mahindra group, together with affiliate Tech Mahindra, have 76\u00a0% stake from holding company Pincar for 25.3 million euros. The Indian company will offer the same price for the remaining stock. In addition to buying stock, Mahindra will invest 20 million euros in Pininfarina and provide a guarantee to creditors of 114.5 million euros. On December 10, 2011 Pininfarina announced it would end all automotive production. In truth production ended in November 2010 with the conclusion of the contract to produce the Alfa Romeo Brera and Spider at the San Giorgio plant.[36] Opened in 1958 with nearly 1,000 employees, by 1960 output exceeded 11,000 car bodies.[37] In 2009 Pininfarina sold the factory to Finpiemonte, the public finance of the Piedmont Region, at the price of 14.4 million euro. Finpiemonte, as part of the deal, leases the plant to Gian Mario Rossignol at a rent of per year for six years renewable.[38] The Grugliasco sale did not include an adjacent structure that houses the wind tunnel.[39] Opened in 1986 to build Cadillac Allante bodies for General Motors,[40] the same year Pininfarina was first listed on the Stock Exchange in Milan. Automotive production ended at San Giorgio with the conclusion of the Ford production in July 2010, and Alfa Romeo production in November 2010.[39] Following the end of contract manufacturing activities San Giorgio Canavese is being used for production of spare parts for cars manufactured in the past.[41] Pininfarina opened its third manufacturing plant in 1997. Currently Pininfarina leases the plant and 57 employees to the Cecomp Group. This agreement to produce 4,000 electric Bollor\u00e9 Bluecars runs from 1 April 2011 to 31 December 2013.[41] On 13 September 2013 a new lease agreement was announced, this new agreement will run from 1 January 2014 until the end of 2016.[42] A joint venture between Pininfarina S.p.A. and Volvo Car Corporation began in 2003. Volvo and Pininfarina S.p.A. have agreed upon the termination of the joint venture agreement regarding Pininfarina Sverige AB and its operations in Uddevalla, Sweden. As of 31 December 2011 the termination this agreement would result in a 30 million euros fee paid to Pininfarina.[41] On 25 June 2013 the last Volvo C70 was produced and the Uddevalla assembly plant was closed.[43] Although Pininfarina rarely gave credit to individuals,[44] that policy seems to have changed in recent years[45]  and many of the designers of the past have become known. As of 2016 Pininfarina employs 98 people in their design department,[46] that is down from 185 in 2005.[47] Pininfarina designs, manufactures, assembles, and tests prototypes and production vehicles under contract for other automakers. As of 10 December 2011 Pininfarina announced it would end all mass automotive production with the sale of its 40% stake in the Uddevalla, Sweden plant to Volvo in 2013. In the past Pininfarina has produced both cars and car-bodies under contract from other automakers. This production includes Pininfarina-designed cars and vehicles designed by others. A sortable list of complete cars or car bodies manufactured in one of the five Pininfarina factories: Before the war Pininfarina built car bodies mostly for individual customers, many of the bodies were \"one offs\" and not mass-produced. In addition to production vehicles, Pininfarina creates prototype, show, and custom cars for auto manufacturers, as well as private clients. Most prototypes\u2014such as the Ferrari Mythos, were concept cars, although several have become production models, including the Ferrari 612 Scaglietti and Ferrari F50. A recent privately commissioned custom example was the Ferrari P4/5 of 2006, a one-car rebody (changing the exterior design) of the Enzo Ferrari according to the client's specifications. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car though the engine, drivetrain and many other components are simply modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo it was derived from. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on 18 August 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September. Another recent prototype is the Pininfarina Nido, a two-seater sub-compact that could possibly make airbags obsolete. The Pininfarina B0 solar-electric concept, designed with Bollor\u00e9 was shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show featuring a range between charges of more than 150 miles (241\u00a0km) with an electronically limited 88-mile-per-hour (142\u00a0km/h) top speed, and an estimated acceleration to 37 miles per hour (60\u00a0km/h) in 6.3 seconds.[126] The car has solar panels on the roof and on the nose, while its battery pack is said to last up to 125,000 miles (201,168\u00a0km).[127] On 15 May 2013 Pininfarina announced the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coup\u00e9 to be revealed on 24 May at the Concorso d\u2019Eleganza Villa d\u2019Este. Pininfarina announced this one-off concept car as the first collaboration between BMW and Pininfarina,[128] but in 1949 BMW commissioned Pininfarina design and build a prototype of the BMW 501\u2014it was rejected for being too modern.[129] A list of Post WWII cars designed by Pininfarina that went into production. Pininfarina has an area dedicated to the new electric car Pininfarina Bollor\u00e9. Batteries are produced by the French Bollor\u00e9 Group.[228] Pininfarina, has introduced its own electric vehicle concept, the Pininfarina B0 (pronounced \"B Zero\"). The four-seat hatchback features a solid-state lithium-polymer battery, supercapacitors, and a roof- integrated solar panel to achieve a range of 153 miles (246\u00a0km). Developed in partnership with the Bolore Group, the vehicle was slated for limited production in 2009 as the Bollor\u00e9 Bluecar.[229] Pininfarina will display a turbine-powered plug-in hybrid called the Cambiano at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.[230] At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show Pininfarina revealed the H2 Speed, an electric sports car concept.[231] The H2 Speed is a hydrogen vehicle with two race-specification electric motors which are fed by a hydrogen fuel cell.[232] The hydrogen power unit was designed by Swiss company GreenGT.[233] On 27 November 2018, it was announced that Automobili Pininfarina had invested over \u20ac20m in Pininfarina design services to support plans for its range of luxury electric cars.[234] This includes design and engineering services for the first Pininfarina-branded hyper performance car which is a luxury electric hypercar called the Battista (named after company founder Battista 'Pinin' Farina and originally codenamed PF0).[235] With four electric motors, the car is supposed to be able to reach 100 km/h in under two seconds with a maximum velocity of 350 km/h.[236] Automobili Pininfarina plans to reveal the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show.[236] Further details on the Battista surfaced on March 4, 2019. It has 1900 horsepower, and only 150 will be built. It is also related to the Rimac C Two.[237] Pininfarina also works with other companies such as SimpleTech for product design.[251] Other Pininfarina product designs include the 2006 Winter Olympics torch, cauldron and medals, as well as major appliance collections for Gorenje.[252] On December 1999, Pininfarina cooperated with Casio and designed a watch under its label, the G-Shock GE-2000.[253] However, the watch received negative critics from the fans due to its weak strap, which was vulnerable to breaks during normal use.[254] Pininfarina was a design contractor for the development of Coca-Cola Freestyle.[255][256] Pininfarina Extra, founded in 1986, is the Pininfarina Group design company which does not work in the transport sector.

S.p.A. is a multinational company based in Milan, Italy, listed on the Milan Stock Exchange since 1922,[4] with a temporary privatization period by the consortium led by the Chinese state-owned enterprise ChemChina. The company is the 5th[5] largest tyre manufacturer behind Bridgestone, Michelin,  Goodyear and Continental, and is focused on the consumer business (tyres for cars,  motorcycles and bicycles). It is present in Europe, Apac, Latam, Meai, Nafta and C.I.S., operating commercially in over 160 countries. It has 19 manufacturing sites[6] in 13 countries and a network of around 14,600 distributors and retailers.[7] Pirelli has been sponsoring sport competitions since 1907 and is the exclusive tyre supplier for the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series for 2008\u20132010, FIA Formula One World Championship for 2011\u20132023[8] and for the FIM World Superbike Championship.[9] Pirelli's headquarters are located in Milan's Bicocca district. Pirelli is now a pure tyre manufacturing company. In the past it has been involved in fashion and operated in renewable energy and sustainable mobility. On 4 October 2017, Pirelli returned to the Milan Stock Exchange[10] after focusing its business on pure consumer products (tyre for car, motorcycles, bicycles) and related services, and separating the business of industrial tyre.[11] Pirelli has published its Pirelli Calendar since 1964, which has featured the contribution of famous photographers over the years like Helmut Newton, Steve McCurry, Peter Lindbergh, Richard Avedon, Bruce Weber, Herb Rits and Annie Leibovitz. Founded in Milan in 1872 by Giovanni Battista Pirelli, the company initially specialised in rubber and derivative processes and also made scuba diving rebreathers.[12] Thereafter, Pirelli's activities were primarily focused on the production of tyres and cables (for energy and telecommunications). In 2005, Pirelli sold its cable division to Goldman Sachs, which changed the new group's name to Prysmian. In the 1950s, Alberto Pirelli commissioned the building of a skyscraper, Pirelli Tower, in the same Milanese area that housed the very first Pirelli factory during the 19th century.[13] In 1974, Pirelli invented the \"wide radial tyre\", upon a request from the Lancia rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to withstand the power of the new Lancia Stratos. At that time, racing tyres were either slick tyres made with the cross ply technique (very wide tyres with a reduced sidewall height), or radial tyres, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10\u00a0km, and the slicks too stiff. Lancia asked Pirelli for a solution, and in 1975 Pirelli created a wide tyre with a reduced sidewall height like a slick, but with a radial structure. Subsequently, Porsche started using the same tyres with the Porsche 911 Turbo. In 1988, Pirelli acquired the Armstrong Rubber Company, which was headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut, for $190 million.[14] In 2000, Pirelli sold its terrestrial fibre optic cables business to Cisco and its optical components operations to Corning, for 5 billion euro.[15] It invested \u2013 through Olimpia -part of the resulting liquidity to become a majority shareholder in Telecom Italia in 2001,[16] maintaining this position until 2007.[17] In 2002 the company started a range of Pirelli branded clothing, watches and eyewear.[18] In 2005, Pirelli sold its Cables, Energy Systems and Telecommunications assets to Goldman Sachs[19] and the newly formed company was named Prysmian. In the same year, 2005, Pirelli opened its first tyre production plant in Shandong province, China.[20] This was the beginning of the group's production complex in the country. In 2006, Pirelli chose Slatina for its first tyre production plant in Romania, extending the facility in 2011.[21] In 2010, Pirelli completed its conversion to a pure tyre company by selling Pirelli Broadband Solutions[22] and spinning off the real estate assets of Pirelli Re.[23] Fondazione Pirelli was established in the same year to safeguard and celebrate the company's past and to promote business culture as an integral part of Italy's national cultural assets. In March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a \u20ac7.1 billion bid from ChemChina, together with Camfin and LTI, for the company.[24] The transaction was completed and the company was delisted in November 2015.[25] In May 2017, it was announced that Pirelli returns to the world of cycling with a new road cycling tyre range, Pzero Velo.[26] In September 2017, the company announced the will to sell up to 40 percent of its equity capital in an initial public offering as it plans to return to the Milan stock exchange in October.[27] In March 2019 Pirelli announced a new range of mountainbiking tires, called Scorpion. Pirelli is focused on the consumer business, producing tyres for cars, motorcycles and bicycles. PZero: tyres for ultra-high performance cars. including F1 vehicles Cinturato: tyres for high end cars. Winter: tyres for low temperatures and snow. Scorpion: tyres for SUV and cross-over Diablo: road and track tyres. Scorpion: road and off-road tyres. PZero Velo: road racing. Cycl-e: urban and electric. Scorpion: Mountainbike The list of Pirelli shareholders[28]: The list of Pirelli Board of Directors:[30] (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) (million \u20ac) *The performance takes into account, as well as the deconsolidation of Venezuela, a non-recurring fiscal impact of 107.6 million euro linked to the devaluation of active deferred taxation by the Parent Group as a consequence of Pirelli\u2019s new financial status after its merger with Marco Polo Industrial Holding. The Pirelli Calendar is published annually, and regularly features famous actresses and fashion models. The calendar also features the work of many of the most respected fashion photographers in the world, including Herb Ritz, Richard Avedon, Mert & Marcus, Peter Lindbergh, Annie Leibovitz, and Patrick Demarchelier. The Pirelli Internetional Award is given annually for the best international multimedia involving the communication of science and technology conducted entirely on the Internet. \"Power is nothing without control\" was the well known slogan of Pirelli Tyre Company, and was featured in numerous television and print advertisements. Pirelli is the long-serving main sponsor of Italian football club Inter Milan, having sponsored the Italian team since the 1995\u201396 season.[32] Pirelli has a history of sponsoring football teams. Pirelli is well known for its long term primary sponsorship of the Italian football club Inter Milan since 1995. Pirelli previously appeared as a sponsor on the shirts of the Maltese football club Valletta for a short time. In reference to Brazil striker Ronaldo\u2019s usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched, Pirelli ran a 1998 commercial in which he replaced the figure of Christ from the Christ the Redeemer statue that towers over his home city of Rio de Janeiro while in an Inter Milan strip.[33] It was controversial with the Catholic Church.[34] Pirelli's sponsorship of football teams is not limited to Europe, South America is a key market and as a result successful clubs have also been sponsored by the tyre company. The Brazilian team Palmeiras, Uruguayan team Pe\u00f1arol and Argentinian side V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield all had Pirelli as a shirt sponsor. When English football club Burton Albion Football Club built their new stadium in 2005, Pirelli became the title sponsor of the new ground. This was because the new stadium, named Pirelli Stadium lies next to the Pirelli factory in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England. In 2009 Pirelli became the title sponsor of the Chinese Super League (CSL), China's top tier football league. In 2012, the company become a major sponsor of the Russian Cup. Pirelli is currently the event title sponsor of the Spanish and Hungarian Grands Prix and sponsored the 2018 French Grand Prix. Pirelli supported rally with their FIA Pirelli Star Driver program as an initiative to support young rally drivers.[35] Pirelli is sponsor of Emirates Team New Zealand in the 35th America's Cup (2017).[36] Pirelli sponsors Alpine World Ski Championship and Ice Hockey World Championship IIHF from 2017 to 2021.[37] The company is also sponsor of the Italian Ski Team and of the Swiss Ski Team.[38] Pirelli is the only allowed tyre brand in the FIM World Superbike Championship since 2007 (along with its support classes, such as the Supersport World Championship). Pirelli has also been awarded the contract for the control tyre supply in the British Superbike Championship from 2008 until at least 2010.[39] Pirelli were also the official tyre supplier of the World Rally Championship from 2008 to 2010, until the company withdrew to focus on its Formula 1 commitments. Pirelli returned to the championship in 2014, however they only supply tyres for a few private teams as Michelin is the major tyre supplier. Pirelli was also supplied Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series from 2008 until at least 2010 before replaced by Continental AG in 2011. Pirelli is sponsor of rally and gymkhana driver Ken Block's Hoonigan Racing Division since 2010. Pirelli is the sole tyre supplier in Formula One, following Bridgestone's decision to withdraw from the role at the end of 2010.[40][41][42] Pirelli previously competed in Formula One from 1950\u20131958, 1981\u20131986 and 1989\u20131991. Pirelli has also supplied tyres for all FIA Formula 2 Championship and GP3 Series cars since 2011 and 2010 respectively. The tyre manufacturer introduced a colour coding to recognize tyre compounds used by drivers during the racing weekend.[43] For the benefit of the spectators at the track and the television audiences each compound has its own colour coding on the Pirelli and P Zero logos which appear on the sidewalls of the tyre. For the 2019 season, Pirelli reverted to using 3 colours to identify the dry weather tyres. However these will be used for 5 different compounds and will be identified as below: Pirelli were asked to design tyres that degraded rapidly in order to promote more pit stops and closer racing. At the end of the 2011 season, many F1 drivers praised Pirelli's comeback.[45] Controversy surrounded Pirelli's Formula 1 tyres as at the 2013 British Grand Prix seven Pirelli tyres failed: P\u00e9rez twice, Alonso, Hamilton, Gutierrez, Vergne, and Massa. Following a safety car period drivers were instructed to stay off the kerbs that were later found to be \"razor sharp\" and may have been the cause, but the president of the British Racing Drivers' Club rejected the idea that the kerbs could be at fault, saying that \"These kerbs have been in since 2009 and we have had thousands and thousands of cars go over these kerbs and they have been absolutely fine\".[46] The incidents were described as \"unacceptable\" by F1 drivers.[47] It was later suggested that the cause of the tyre failures could be the teams putting them on the wrong side of the car. Pirelli stressed that the tyres are of an asymmetrical construction and are not interchangeable, and that if they are used correctly, they do not pose a threat to safety.[48] Pirelli changed the construction of the tyres to prevent further incidents, switching to kevlar belts.[49] During the second practice of the 2013 Belgian Grand Prix, two tyres failed: Vettel and Alonso. One senior figure at Pirelli described the failures as a \"big concern\", whilst Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery admitted the tyre failures were \"a worry for the sport\".[50] Following these issues, just one day later Michelin announced that they could replace Pirelli as the tyre supplier for 2014. In October 2013 Fernando Alonso complained that \"the quality of the tyres is very on the limit\", and that they \"will not do 5km\". Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery said: \"Of course Alonso is one of the great F1 drivers, so to hear such comments is disappointing and below the standards you would expect from such a champion.[51] In the Korean Grand Prix P\u00e9rez locked a front tyre heavily and then suffered a dramatic failure on the subsequent long straight.[52] Pirelli hit controversy at the Indian Grand Prix where they requested the teams run the tyres a limited number of laps due to their fragility. One senior engineer at a top team said this was the worst blistering ever experienced.[53] In pre-season testing for the 2014 season the tyre on Rosberg's car failed, sending Rosberg into a 200\u00a0mph (322\u00a0km/h) spin.[54] The incident prompted considerable alarm, and Pirelli stated that the tyre \"will not be proposed again\".[55] In January 2014 Pirelli signed a contract with the FIA to supply tyres to Formula One for the 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons.[56] Later in 2014 Lewis Hamilton described the Pirelli wet weather tyres as \"They're not great tyres. That's no secret\".[57] \"These are comments by drivers that have not been made in an official way to us. Of course, if Pirelli was requested by the teams and the FIA to reconsider the technical capability of the wet tyre, Pirelli would do it immediately\" was the comment of Pirelli's motorsport director Paul Hembery.[57] At the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix, during practice, Rosberg suffered a dangerous tyre delamination at 200\u00a0mph (322\u00a0km/h). Rosberg said the incident was \"quite a shock\".  During the subsequent drivers' briefing, double world champion Lewis Hamilton raised concerns about tyre safety following the high-speed blow-out suffered by teammate Nico Rosberg. Concerns were also brought up by four-time world champion Vettel, and double world champion Alonso. Pirelli relied on race director, Charlie Whiting, to defend Pirelli's record in the meeting.[58] During the race a tyre on Vettel's car suffered from a blowout at 200\u00a0mph (322\u00a0km/h). The four time world champion described the failure an \"unacceptable\", and added that Pirelli's tendency to blame failures either on debris on track or a driver going over a kerb for tyre failures was incorrect, confirming that \"I didn't go off the track and out of the blue the tyre explodes\".[59] Following the race Rosberg was critical of the poor quality of Pirelli tyres, saying \"Vettel exploding his tyre is really poor. It shouldn't happen and that it keeps on happening, in other categories as well and today with us, and with me on Friday both of us were just so lucky\".[60] The Grand Prix Drivers' Association chairman said: \"We need to stop the sudden explosions.\"[61] Immediately after the race Pirelli claimed that excessive wear caused the blowout, blaming Ferrari for running the tyre too long. However, following a more detailed analysis Pirelli said that in fact wear was not to blame, but instead a cut had caused the tyre failure.[62] To counteract further problems at the next Grand Prix, Monza, Pirelli wanted to insist that teams run the tyres at high pressure, beyond their design parameters. However, double world champion Lewis Hamilton described these rules as a \"disaster\" and double world champion Fernando Alonso described them as \"strange\" so Pirelli was forced to backtrack on their proposal.[63] After these comments, Pirelli attempted to censor the drivers by asking them to not criticise the tyres in public in the future.[64] The situation did not improve at the next Grand Prix at Monza. Here, Pirelli reported a higher than expected number of cuts forming in the tyres.[65] During the race, one of Hamilton's tyres dropped below the regulation pressure dictated by Pirelli, despite the tyre having been prepared by a Pirelli technician.[66] Neither Mercedes nor Hamilton were punished for the infringement.[67] Later in 2016, the necessity to run Pirelli tyres at high pressure was described as a \"joke\" by triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, world champion Jenson Button, and world championship runner-up Felipe Massa.[68] Above any criticisms, in 2016 the renewal of the contract as sole supplier was strongly supported by the protagonists of the Formula 1 circus.[69] A number of changes to the Formula 1 tyres were introduced for the 2017 season. The most obvious visual difference was an increase of width by 25%, both front and rear, increasing from 245 to 305mm at the front and 325 to 405mm at the rear. The actual rim size remained unchanged from the traditional 13 inches.[70] This is part of a package of measures expected to cut lap times by around five seconds relative to 2015: although the improvement might be even bigger. Most of that extra speed has been found through corners, as the cars have got wider and will generate at least 20% more downforce compared to last year thanks to bigger wings and increased aerodynamics.[71] These faster cornering speeds\u2014to the extent that some corners have now effectively become straights, already leading to circuit modifications\u2014have imposed significantly increased loads on the tyres, meaning that there is a completely new philosophy behind Pirelli\u2019s 2017 range. Having followed the brief to provide deliberate degradation for the past six seasons, there is now a new directive to make tyres with less degradation that are more resistant to overheating for the latest generation of much faster cars.[72] As a result, the tyre structure and compounds are brand new. In April 2012, Pirelli & C. SpA signed joint venture agreement with Indonesian counterpart PT Astra Autoparts a subsidiary of PT Astra International for the construction of a motorcycle tyre plant with a total investment of $120 million. 60 percent shares will be held by Pirelli. Pirelli hoped to strengthen its presence in the largest motorcycle market in the world, the Southeast Asia region which has 250 million motorcycles.[73] In July 2018, Pirelli launched a F1 wheel shaped Bluetooth speaker, P Zero Sound.[74] The Bluetooth speaker measures 12.9-inches in diameter, weighs 21 pounds and has a 100-watt amplifier, a 100mm midwoofer, a 25mm tweeter and also offers Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX for wireless connectivity. IXOOST[75] is the manufacturer of P Zero Sound speaker, which majorly manufactures Motorsports-themed audio systems. The wheel shaped speaker costs \u20ac2400, which is equivalent to about $2,800.

            "text": "Pogliaghi was an Italian racing bicycle manufacturer, based in Milan, Italy. The company was founded by Sante Pogliaghi in 1947.  Pogliaghi did much of the work, but had up to six staff by the late 1970s, when production increased from 300 frames a year to 800. [1] Cyclists such as Patrick Sercu and Eddy Merckx used Pogliaghi frames. Sante Pogliaghi's speciality was tandem, stayer and track bicycles. Sante Pogliaghi died in 2000. Pogliaghi sold or transferred rights to build bicycles under his name in the 1983-84. The difference between a Pogliaghi made under his direct supervision and one that may not be is the *PSM* stamp on the seat-lug, and a chronologically-sequential serial number on the seat-lug or the head-lug.  This serial number sequence appears to date all the way back to when Pogliaghi's uncle Brambilla owned the shop, where Sante Pogliaghi worked for him.  Pogliaghi continued the serial number sequence when he took over in the late 1940s. Pogliaghi is on record stating he would retire by 1980, when he was interviewed for the book \"The Custom Bicycle\"  but he officially closed his workshop on 1983. The PSM stamp and the serial numbers disappeared after the marque transfer. Marc Rossin supposedly took over rights to the marque first, and a number of Pogliaghis appeared with Rossin-style pantographing. Probably by the late 1980s rights to the name had passed to the Basso brothers.  ",

            "text": " Poste Italiane S.p.A. is the Italian postal service provider. Besides providing postal services, Gruppo Poste Italiane offers integrated communication, postal savings products, logistics, financial and insurance services throughout Italy. The n.604 national law of 5 May 1862, (the so-called Postal reform),[4] created a national and centralized organization for postal service by the introduction of a unique general fee to pay for services, the postal stamps, among the whole territory of the newly formed kingdom of Italy. Subsequently, with the Royal Decree 5973 of 10 March 1889, the Directorate General of Posts and Telegraphs was separated from the Ministry of Public Works and thus turned into the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. It was commissioned to create a network of offices in Italy to forward and receive mail and telegrams, to make and receive telephone calls, and to carry out financial transactions and assets management. It also worked as branch offices for the nascent electric services for a time. The giro service, (commonly known as BancoPosta since 2000), was founded in 1917.  In 1924, during the Fascist period, the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs was renamed Ministry of Communications becoming an important center of power. The services network was expanded with the acquisition and implementation of new logistics facilities. New buildings in Functionalist style were built in the major cities. With the development of telephony and radio communication, the Ministry incorporated the State Company for Telephone Services (ASST) and the nascent EIAR (which would later become RAI and run both public radio and television). In the early 90s, the Italian public administration and postal service were deemed irrecoverable in efficiency and profitability. The budget deficit increased personnel costs, which in 1986 absorbed about 93% (including 16% for pensions) of the current revenue. From 1970 to 1985 employees\u2019 productivity was reduced by 24% at the expense of the quality of services provided, generating an ever more critical deficit situation. In 1994, in (Germany), the regular average of the delivered daily mail after dispatch was almost 80%, while in Italy the comparable statistic was less than 20%. In 1989, the average time for mail delivery was 8.5 days. They tried to contain the obvious gap in the quality of Italian postal service compared to the rest of Europe, with the n.487 Decree-Law of 1 December 1993, converted by n.71 law of 29 January 1994. This led to a transformation of the Italian Post Office from an independent company to a public business, by achieving an additional step in SpA by 1996 (implemented after 28 February 1998).[5]  The transformation process required the adoption of the production efficiency principle, the recovery of the quality of services and the economic and financial recovery by the management of the Italian Post Office. This led to the gradual reduction of the 4,500 billion lira deficit, in 1993, through specific policies to reduce production costs (80% of which due to staff costs[6]), through the increase in revenues from the sale of services to the PA and by a reordering of the tariff system, reaching in 2001 a net profit.[7] In February 1998, the Ministry of the Treasury (The Prodi I Cabinet) appointed Corrado Passera, as the CEO of the newly formed Italian Poste SpA.[8] The business plan made by Corrado Passera from 1998 to 2002, created a staff cutting of 22,000 units.[9] On the other hand, according to some trade union leaders, there was a casualization of contracts for new recruits, cases of widespread harassment and resignation for workload due to the excess of staff cuts. The Solidarity Fund was used for saving on labor costs as well as lowering the average age of the staff. The last two years of missing contribution of the early-retired employees were paid by a deduction in payroll of the new employees for 10 years. The company offsets these losses replacing them by the recruitment of many under-24-years-old young workers, giving them a three-year apprenticeship contracts. In 2000, the Italian Post Office, through its subsidiary SDA Express Courier, acquired 20% of the share capital of the Bartolini company, making officially the Consortium Logistics and Parcels with the three major companies for the sorting of parcels in the country. This agreement was also the subject of a challenge by the rival companies in court, but it ended in favor of the Consortium. Poste Italiane has also adopted a control system to monitoring in real time all the post offices, the logistics network and the security of digital communications and transactions working with the Italian government, international agencies, universities and research centers. The importance of financial products and services such as the Postepay prepaid card, have been increasing in the last few years. Postepay, introduced first in 2003, achieved a great success, especially among the youngest, conquering and maintaining first position at European level among pre-paid cards sector. In 2011, Poste Italiane acquired UniCredit MedioCredito Centrale for \u20ac136\u00a0million.[10] On 16 May 2014, the Italian government approved the stakes sale of up to 40 percent in Poste Italiane.[11] The company was forced to close 455 offices in 2015 due low profit,[12] according to the Poste Italiane Spa CEO Francesco Caio\u2019s decision. Today, as underlined by CEO Matteo Del Fante in November 2018th, company\u2019s intention is to preserve postal offices and take specific measures for littlest Italian cities[4]. Ministry of Economy and Finance (Italy), which now owns 64.696% of Poste Italiane Spa, shared about 35% to Borsa Italiana. On 25 May 2016, a further 35% stake was transferred from the ministry to Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), making the minority shareholder of the national investment bank. This has given equity in stakes for Poste Italiane, but has also diluted its voting rights in CDP.[13] One of the main business of the company is BancoPosta, a division within Poste Italiane S.p.A., which acts as a distribution platform providing postal savings services. The bank division, known as BancoPosta ring-fenced capital reserve, (BancoPosta FRC) in the balance sheet, had total assets of \u20ac56,969,835,924 as at 31 December 2014. If BancoPosta was a separate company, it would make the bank ranked as the 10th largest bank by total assets. Cariparma, which ranked as the 10th in the research of Ricerche e Studi (a subsidiary of Mediobanca), had total assets of \u20ac50,296,831,000 as at 31 December 2014, despite the list also omitted some bank before Cariparma.[14] Mail delivery, logistics, parcels and express delivery, have always been a key part of Poste Italiane\u2019s identity and also include Italy\u2019s Universal Postal Service. In  2018,  Poste Italiane handled  approximately  3  billion  items  of  mail  and  127 million  parcels, In the Deliver  2022  Plan  in  2018,  the company  launched  the  new  Joint  Delivery  model,  which has  redesigned  the  service  by  introducing  afternoon  and  weekend  deliveries and focused on  modernising  the fleet,  by  making  it more  environmentally-friendly  with the  introduction  of  345  fully  electric,  three-wheeled  scooters,  with  greater  load  capacity  to facilitate parcel delivery in cities and improve occupational safety. The  evolution  of  e-commerce  logistics  has  led  to  the  creation  of  PuntoPoste,  the  new  accessible  network  that  complements  the  network  of over  12,800  post  offices,  enabling  the collection  and  return  of  online  purchases  and  the  sending  of  pre-franked  or  prepaid  parcels.  In 2018,  417  PuntoPoste  points  were  already  operating,  and  the  network  will  be  expanded  to include  3,500  units  in  2019.[15]  [16]  [17] Payments, mobile and digital services: Following the new opportunities created by the European Payment Services Directive (PSD2)[5], in force as of January 2018, Poste Italiane decided to bring together payment, mobile and digital services under a single unit. The new division takes over the mobile phone operations of PosteMobile[6] and continues to be a provider of digital services for the Public Sector. Insurance: Poste Italiane\u00a0 operates in the insurance business through PosteVita and Poste Assicura, offering life and casualty insurance products. Poste Vita additionally offers investment and savings products through Bancoposta distribution platform. ",

(/\u02c8pr\u0251\u02d0d\u0259/ PRAH-d\u0259, Italian:\u00a0[\u02c8pra\u02d0da]) is an Italian luxury fashion house, specializing in leather handbags, travel accessories, shoes, ready-to-wear, perfumes and other fashion accessories, founded in 1913 by Mario Prada. The company was started in 1913 by Mario Prada and his brother Martino as a leather goods shop \u2013 Fratelli Prada \u2013 in Milan, Italy.[4][5] Initially, the shop sold animal goods and imported English steamer trunks and handbags. Mario Prada did not believe that women should have a role in business, and so he prevented female family members from entering his company. Ironically, Mario's son harbored no interest in the business, so it was his daughter Luisa Prada who took the helm of Prada as his successor, and ran it for almost twenty years. Her own daughter, Miuccia Prada, joined the company in 1970, eventually taking over for her mother in 1978. Miuccia began making waterproof backpacks out of Pocone, a nylon fabric.[4] She met Patrizio Bertelli in 1977, an Italian who had begun his own leather goods business at the age of 24, and he joined the company soon after. He advised Miuccia on company business, which she followed. It was his advice to discontinue importing English goods and to change the existing luggage. Miuccia inherited the company in 1978 by which time sales were up to U.S. $450,000. With Bertelli alongside her as business manager, Miuccia was allowed time to implement her creativity in the company's designs.[4] She would go on to incorporate her ideas into the house of Prada that would change it.[4] She released her first set of backpacks and totes in 1979. They were made out of a tough military spec black nylon that her grandfather had used as coverings for steamer trunks. Initial success was not instant, as they were hard to sell due to the lack of advertising and high prices, but the lines would go on to become her first commercial hit. Next, Miuccia and Bertelli sought out wholesale accounts for the bags in upscale department stores and boutiques worldwide. In 1983, Prada opened a second boutique in the centre of the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan's shopping heart, on the site of the previous historic \"London House\" emporium run by Felice Bellini from 1870 to the 1960s, reminiscent of the original shop, but with a sleek and modern contrast to it. The next big release was a nylon tote. That same year, the house of Prada began expansion across continental Europe and the United States by opening locations in prominent shopping districts within Florence, Paris, Madrid, and New York City. A shoe line was also released in 1984. In 1985 Miuccia released the \"classic Prada handbag\" that became an overnight sensation. Although practical and sturdy, its sleek lines and craftsmanship had a luxury that has become the Prada signature. In 1987 Miuccia and Bertelli married. Prada launched its women's ready-to-wear collection in 1989, and the designs came to be known for their dropped waistlines and narrow belts. Prada's popularity increased when the fashion world took notice of its clean lines, opulent fabrics, and basic colors. The logo for the label was not as obvious a design element as those on bags from other prominent luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton. It tried to market its lack of prestigious appeal, including of its apparel, by projecting an image of \"anti-status\" or \"inverse snobbery\". Prada's originality made it one of the most influential fashion houses,[4] and the brand became a premium status symbol in the 1990s. Sales were reported at L 70\u00a0billion, or US$31.7\u00a0million, in 1998.[citation needed] Partrizio di Marco took charge of the growing business in the United States after working for the house in Asia. He was successful in having the Prada bags prominently displayed in department stores, so that they could become a hit with fashion editors. Prada's continued success was attributed to its \"working-class\" theme which, Ginia Bellafante at The New York Times Magazine proclaimed, \"was becoming chic in the high-tech, IPO-driven early 1990s.\" Furthermore, now husband and wife, Miuccia and Bertelli led the Prada label on a cautious expansion, making products hard to come by. In 1992, the high fashion brand Miu Miu, named after Miuccia's nickname, launched. Miu Miu catered to younger consumers, such as celebrities. By 1993 Prada was awarded the Council of Fashion Designers of America award for accessories.[4] Men's ready-to-wear collections were launched in the mid-1990s. By 1994, sales were at US$210\u00a0million, with clothing sales accounting for 20% (expected to double in 1995). Prada won another award from the CFDA, in 1995 as a \"designer of the year\" 1996 witnessed the opening of the 18,000\u00a0ft\u00b2 Prada boutique in Manhattan, New York, the largest in the chain at the time. By now the House of Prada operated in 40 locations worldwide, 20 of which were in Japan. The company owned eight factories and subcontracted work from 84 other manufacturers in Italy. Miuccia's Prada and Bertelli company were merged to create Prapar B.V. in 1996. The name, however, was later changed to Prada B.V., and Patrizio Bertelli was named Chief Executive Officer of the Prada luxury company. 1996 can also be seen as marking an important turning point in Prada\u2019s aesthetics, one that fueled the brand\u2019s worldwide reputation. Journalists praised Miuccia\u2019s development of an \u201cugly chic\u201d style, which initially confused customers by offering blatantly unsexy outfits which then revealed to offer daring and original takes on the relationship between fashion and desire.[6] Since then Prada has been regarded as one of the most intelligent and conceptual designers. In 1997, Prada posted revenue of US$674\u00a0million. Another store in Milan opened that same year. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bertelli smashed the windows of the store a day before the opening, after he had become deeply unsatisfied with the set-up. Prada also acquired shares in the Gucci group, and later blamed Gucci for \"aping his wife's designs.\" In June 1998, Bertelli gained 9.5% interests at US$260\u00a0million.[citation needed] Analysts began to speculate that he was attempting a take over of the Gucci group. The proposition seemed unlikely, however, because Prada was at the time still a small company and was in debt. Funding Universe states that \"At the very least, Prada had a voice as one of Gucci's largest shareholders (a 10 percent holding would be required for the right to request a seat on the board) and would stand to profit tidily should anyone try to take over Gucci.\" However, Bertelli sold his shares to Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy \u2022 Louis Vuitton chairman Bernard Arnault in January 1998 for a profit of US$140\u00a0million. Arnault was in fact attempting a take over of Gucci. LVMH had been purchasing fashion companies for a while and already owned Dior, Givenchy, and other luxury brands. Gucci, however, managed to fend him off by selling a 45% stake to industrialist Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, for US$3\u00a0billion.[citation needed] In 1998, the first Prada menswear boutique opened in Los Angeles. Prada was determined to hold a leading portfolio of luxury brands, like the Gucci group and LVMH. Prada purchased 51% of Helmut Lang's company based in New York for US$40\u00a0million in March 1999.[citation needed] Lang's company was worth about US$100\u00a0million. Months later, Prada paid US$105\u00a0million to have full control of Jil Sander A.G., a German-based company with annual revenue of US$100\u00a0million. The purchase gained Prada a foothold in Germany, and months later Jil Sander resigned as chairwoman of her namesake company. Church & Company, an English shoes maker, also came under the control of Prada, when Prada bought 83% of the company for US$170\u00a0million.[citation needed] A joint venture between Prada and the De Rigo group was also formed that year to produce Prada eyewear. In October 1999, Prada joined with LVMH and beat Gucci to buy a 51% stake in the Rome-based Fendi S.p.A. Prada's share of the purchase (25.5%) was worth US$241.5\u00a0million out of the reported US$520\u00a0million total paid by both Prada and LVMH.[citation needed] Prada took on debts of Fendi, as the latter company was not doing well financially. These acquisitions elevated Prada to the top of the luxury goods market in Europe. Revenue tripled from that of 1996, to L2\u00a0trillion.[citation needed] Despite apparent success, the company was still in debt. The company's merger and purchasing sprees slowed in the 2000s. However, the company signed a loose agreement with Azzedine Alaia. Skin care products in unit doses were introduced in the United States, Japan and Europe in 2000. A 30-day supply of cleansing lotion was marketed at the retail price of US$100. To help pay off debts of over US$850\u00a0million, the company planned on listing 30% of the company on the Milan Stock Exchange in June 2001. However, the offering slowed down after a decline in spending on luxury goods in the United States and Japan. In 2001, under the pressure of his bankers, Bertelli sold all of Prada's 25.5% share in Fendi to LVMH. The sale raised only US$295\u00a0million. By 2006, the Helmut Lang, Amy Fairclough, Ghee, and Jil Sander labels were sold. Jil Sander was sold to the private equity firm Change Capital Partners, which was headed by Luc Vandevelde, the chairman of Carrefour, while the Helmut Lang label is now owned by Japanese fashion company Link Theory. Prada is still recovering from the Fendi debt. More recently, a 45% stake of the Church & Company brand has been sold to Equinox. The Prada Spring/Summer 2009 Ready-to-Wear fashion show, held on 23 September 2008 in Milan, got infamous coverage because of the fact that all the models on the catwalk were tottering[7][8] \u2013 several of them stumbled,[9] while two models fell down in front of the photographers and had to be helped by spectators to get up.[10] They removed their shoes in order to continue their walk.[11][12] One more model (Sigrid Agren) even had to stop and go back during the finale walk as she couldn't manage walking in her high heels any longer.[13] Interviewed right after the show, one model declared: \"I was having a panic attack, my hands were shaking. The heels were so high.\"[14] The designer Miuccia Prada, on her side, did not blame the height of the shoes, but the silk little socks inside, which were slippery and moved inside of the shoes, preventing the models' feet from having a correct grip on the sole.[15][16] Miuccia Prada also assured that the shoes sold in stores would have a lower heel,[17] and that the little socks would be sewn into the shoes in order to prevent further slips. But many fashionistas rightly claimed that the socks, once sewn into the shoes, would be non-washable and would quickly stink and become grey.[18] Consequently, the shoes have never been commercially sold. According to Fortune, Bertelli planned on increasing revenue of the company to US$5\u00a0billion by 2010. Prada is the main buyer from the Turkish leather factory DESA, which was found guilty by the Turkish Supreme Court of illegally dismissing workers who joined a union.[19] The Clean Clothes Campaign, a labor rights organization based in Europe, has called on Prada to ensure that freedom of association is respected at the factory.[20] On January 30, 2013, Clean Clothes Campaign reported, \"Trade Union Harassment Continues at Prada Supplier\".[21] On May 6, 2011, Hong Kong Stock Exchange was accused on approving Prada's IPO during Prada Gender Discrimination Case which Prada was ultimately to win.  Female NGOs and the member of Hong Kong Legislative Council and Law Maker, Lee Cheuk-yan protested in front of Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[22][23][24][25][26][27] The brand was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to raise $2.14\u00a0billion, but failed to meet expectations reported by AAP on June 17, 2011[28] and Bloomberg.[29] In 2015, Prada's turnover was 3,551.7 million euros, up 1 percent from 2014, while its gross operating profit fell 16.5 percent to 954.2 million euros.[30] In July 2016, Prada clothing became available to purchase online for the first time through Net-a-Porter and MyTheresa.[31] As of March 2018, Prada's sales turned positive after declining since 2014, and their stock jumped 14% at the news.[32] Stating that Prada would be \"(f)ocusing on innovative materials will allow the company to explore new boundaries of creative design while meeting the demand for ethical products,\" the company announced in 2019 that fur will be eliminated from the collection and all house brands as of 2020.[33] Patrizio Bertelli's passion for sailing led Prada to form Team Luna Rossa in 1997 in order to participate in the America's Cup.[34] On September 28, 2017 it was announced by the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron[35] that Prada will be the hosting sponsor of Challenger Selection Series at the 2021 America's Cup, superseding the role of Louis Vuitton started in 1983. The Challenger Selection Series that was the Louis Vuitton Cup, will now be known as the Prada Cup, and the America's Cup Match will be presented by Prada. It will be held in Auckland, New Zealand, January 2021. It will be noted that if \"by reason of natural disaster or other\" the event is prevented from being held in Auckland, it will be held in Italy. Prada hosts seasonal runway shows on the international fashion calendar, taking place in Milan often at one of the brand's spaces. 1988 \u2013 First womenswear show in Milan 1993 \u2013 First menswear show in Milan Resort 2019 was shown in New York City at Prada's New York headquarters.[36] The show was broadcast over screens in Times Square.[37] Previous Prada models include Daria Werbowy, Gemma Ward, Vanessa Axente, Suvi Koponen, Ali Stephens, Vlada Roslyakova and Sasha Pivovarova, who went on to appear in Prada's ad campaigns for six consecutive seasons after opening the Prada fall 2005 runway show.  Prada has also featured many actors as models in their menswear shows and campaigns, including Gary Oldman, Adrian Brody, Emile Hirsch[38] and Norman Reedus.[39] Prada's runway music is designed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez.[40] Prada has commissioned architects, most notably Rem Koolhaas and Herzog & de Meuron, to design flagship stores in various locations.  1913 \u2013 The original Prada store opened in Milan in inside the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.[41] 1983 \u2013 Retail expansion sees a new boutique opened in Milan, as well as New York, Madrid, London, Paris and Tokyo. 1991 \u2013 Further retail expansion and more boutiques open in New York City, China, and Japan.[34] 2001 \u2013 Broadway Epicenter in New York City by OMA opens.[42] 2003 \u2013 Tokyo Epicenter by Herzog & de Meuron[43] opens.[44] 2004 \u2013 Los Angeles Epicenter by OMA group opens.[45] Restored in 2012. 2008 \u2013 A duplex megastore was opened in Kuala Lumpur at the Pavilion Kuala Lumpur. 2009 \u2013 A new store focussing on the Prada Made to Order collection opened on Corso Venezia, Milan, designed by architect Robert Baciocchi.[46] 2012 \u2013 In June, Prada opened its largest ever boutique in Dubai's Mall of the Emirates.[47] Inaugurated in 2000, Prada's Milan Headquarters are located in a former industrial space between via Bergamo and Via Fogazzaro.[48] An art installation by Carsten H\u00f6ller that takes the form of a three-story metal slide leads from Miuccia Prada's office to the interior courtyard.[49] Completed in 2002, Prada's New York City Headquarters open, located in a former Times Square piano factory renovated by the Herzog & de Meuron architecture firm.[50] 2003 \u2013 \"Garden-Factories\" Project \u2013 Prada collaborates with architect Guido Canali to rejuvenate the landscape surrounding their manufacturers.[34] In 2004, \"Waist Down \u2013 Skirts by Miuccia Prada\" bowed at the Tokyo Epicenter. A traveling exhibition featuring 100 skirts designed by Miuccia Prada and conceived by curator Kayoko Ota of AMO in collaboration with Mrs. Prada, the exhibition went on to Shanghai, New York, Los Angeles and Seoul.[51] Completed in 2009, Prada commissioned an unusual multi-purpose building from Rem Koolhaus's OMA group called the Prada Transformer in Seoul.[52] The building was first used to display the \"Waist Down \u2013 Skirts by Miuccia Prada\" exhibition, and later changed into a movie theater. In 2012, Mrs. Prada, along with designer Elsa Schiaparelli, was the subject of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition, \"Impossible Conversations\".[53] In 2014, an exhibition called \"Pradasphere\" bowed in Hong Kong and London, highlighting the Prada universe.[54] In 2015 Prada opened a permanent home for Fondazione Prada in Milan. Located in a former distillery redesigned by Rem Koolhaus's OMA group, it hosts a permanent collection of site-specific art as well as galleries of rotating exhibits. Intended to act as a gathering space for the local community,[55] it also features a performance space, movie theater, bookstore, and a cafe \u2013 Bar Luce,[56] with an interior designed by director Wes Anderson.[57] In 2016, after 6 years of restoration Prada opened an events space in a historic residence in the Rong Zhai district of Shanghai, China.[58] 2000 \u2013 Eyewear launched under Prada and Miu Miu labels, manufactured by Luxottica.[34] 2004 \u2013 Fragrance launched with the Puig company.[59] Women's fragrances were followed by men's fragrances in 2006. In May 2007, Prada began producing mobile phones with LG Electronics. Three mobile phones resulted from this collaboration: LG Prada (KE850), LG Prada II (KF900) and LG Prada 3.0. Production of watches started in 2007 and was suspended in 2012. One of the watch models produced by Prada, the Prada Link, is compatible with bluetooth technology and can connect with the LG Prada II mobile phone.[66] The 1999 feature film 10 Things I Hate About You features the following exchange extolling the virtues of Prada ownership:[67] \"Bianca: You know, there's a difference between like and love. I like my Skechers but I love my Prada backpack. Chastity: But I love my Skechers. Bianca: That\u2019s because you don\u2019t have a Prada backpack.\" The 2006 feature film The Devil Wears Prada (based on the book of the same name) earned Meryl Streep an Oscar nomination for her role. Her shoe wardrobe for the film was said to be \"at least 40% Prada\" by the costume designer Patricia Field.[68] Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue and the supposed inspiration for Meryl Streep's character, wore Prada to the film's premiere.[69] In 2005 a false Prada boutique was built as an art installation 26 miles away from Marfa, Texas. Called \"Prada Marfa,\" the purpose of the structure was to eventually disintegrate into its surroundings. Shoes and bags were provided by Miuccia Prada from the Summer Season 2005 collection.[70] Unfortunately, the installation was looted after being completed, so restoration was needed.[71] On December 10, 2009 Rina Bovrisse filed a lawsuit against Prada Japan accusing them of discriminating against women in the workplace who were not young and attractive.[72] Before the trial Bovrisse took her claims to the media gathering support amongst activist groups after all the publicity.  Prada countersued for defamation of character.[73][74] In May 2011, the Feminists rallied outside the Tsim She Tsui branch of Prada, calling on the Hong Kong exchange to veto the brand's initial public offering (IPO)[75] In May 2012, a Labour Network Monitoring Asian Transnational Corporations issued a letter against LVMH Group on appointing Sebastian Suhl as COO of Givenchy while he was in the case of sexual harassment in Japan and Luxembourg.[76]In October 2012, Tokyo District Court Judge Reiko Morioka ruled in favor of Prada, saying their alleged discrimination was \u201cacceptable for a luxury fashion label.\u201d[77] Bovrisse claimed the court was not fair and accused the Judge of screaming at her. Bovrisse took her discrimination claims to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[78] The committee, without mentioning Bovrisse, did issue a report to the Japanese Government urging them to enact regulations that would make sexual harassment in the workplace illegal. On December 14, 2018, Prada was forced to pull a new range of accessories and displays from its stores following complaints that they featured \"blackface imagery.\" Prada scrapped the products after outrage spread online when a New Yorker spotted the character at the Prada's Soho store and blasted the brand for using \"Sambo like imagery\" in a viral Facebook post.[79] Prada stated in a tweet in response, \"Prada Group never had the intention of offending anyone and we abhor all forms of racism and racist imagery. In this interest we will withdraw the characters in question from display and circulation.\"[79] As of 2014[update], Prada was being investigated by Italian prosecutors for possible tax evasion after the luxury-goods company disclosed undeclared taxable income. Prada SpA Chairman Miuccia Prada, Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli and accountant Marco Salomoni have been named in the probe, which is for possible undeclared or false tax claims.[80] The chairwoman of Prada is facing an investigation after it was alleged the company avoided nearly \u00a3400 million in tax by transferring services abroad.[81] Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper said on Friday Prada and Bertelli had paid 420 million euros ($571 million) to Italy's tax agency to settle their tax affairs. Despite the settlement, an investigation continued.[82] As of 2016, prosecutors requested the case be dropped as the debt had been settled.[83] ",

It was owned by engineers and politicians Augusto Stucchi and Giulio Prinetti (1851\u20131908). In 1892 Stucchi Prinetti & Stucchi began manufacturing bicycles. In 1914 Alfonso Calzolari rode a Stucchi to victory in the Giro d'Italia, and the 1919 Giro d'Italia was won by Costante Girardengo on a Stucchi. In 1899 Prinetti & Stucchi started manufacturing motorized tricycles and quadricycles. The Tipo 1, a motorized tricycle utilizing two De Dion engines and a Rochet-Schneider frame, was designed by Ettore Bugatti. In 1900 Bugatti participated in the Targa Rignano in a quadricycle. In 1901 the company was renamed Stucchi & Co. when Giulio Prinetti left to become Italian minister of foreign affairs 1901-03.[1] The reorganisation also triggered Ettore Bugatti's emigration to France where he established the Bugatti car works. Automobile production stopped in 1906.[2] The Stucchi-Prinetti family founded the Societ\u00e0 Generale Elettrica dell'Adamello electric company in 1907.

It is the largest manufacturer of cables in the world measured by revenues.[2] Prysmian Group has sales of over \u20ac11 billions  and  about 30,000 employees across 50 countries, 112 production plants and 25 Research and Development centres.[citation needed] Prysmian Group is a public company, listed on the Borsa Italiana in the FTSE MIB index. Prysmian Srl was created by Goldman Sachs from the cables and systems division of Pirelli & C. S.p.A..  Goldman Sachs signed an agreement on 1 June 2005 to purchase the two companies who made up the division: Pirelli Cavi e Sistemi Energia S.p.A. and Pirelli Cavi e Sistemi Telecom S.p.A. The transaction was completed on 28 July 2005, after regulatory approval by the relevant antitrust authorities.[3] Draka was founded in 1910 by Jan Teewis Duyvis as Hollandsche Draad & Kabel Fabriek. In 1970, Draka was acquired by Philips and became part of the Philips' Wire and Cable division. Through a buyout financed by Parcom and Flint Beheer, Draka became independent in 1986 at which point the name Draka was born. It formerly had a joint venture with Alcatel-Lucent for manufacturing optical fibre, but bought out its partner's 49.9% stake for \u20ac209 million in December 2007. Prysmian Group was created in 2011 through the merger of Prysmian and Draka. In 2009, Italian cable manufacturer Prysmian made a takeover offer for Draka, but doubts began to emerge in August.[4] Prysmian called off the takeover talks in early September.[5] In October 2010, French cable maker Nexans made a \u20ac15/share offer to buy the 43.9% of the company held by Flint Beheer, an investment fund owned by the wealthy Fentener van Vlissingen family.[6] Nexans indicated that it would sell off Draka's telecommunications activities. However, Draka rejected Nexans' offer, and on 22 November 2010 instead accepted Prysmian's new offer of \u20ac17.20/share (9.1x EBITDA). Prysmian intended to integrate Draka's operations into their own, rather than breaking it up; integration costs are estimated at \u20ac170 million over three years.[7] The merger of Prysmian and Draka, and the integration of the two market-leading companies, culminated in the creation of the world's largest cable maker by revenue,[2][8] the Prysmian Group. In December 2017, Prysmian acquired General Cable Corporation of Highland Heights, Kentucky in a $3 billion deal which was finalized on June 6, 2018. ",

Rancilio's earliest machine was 'La Regina' \u2013 a vertical boiler machine, similar to the original Bezzera and Victoria Arduino devices in function and gilded 'Belle Epoque' styling. In 1950, Rancilio released a horizontal boiler machine, the Invicta Horizzontal, showing evidence of the postwar shift toward spare, modern styling. The machine however, still used the same forced-steam brewing method from the early 20th century. By 1953, Rancilio adopted lever piston technology introduced by Gaggia. In 1957, Rancilio released a model which automated the lever process, the H/L Automatica. The company followed new technological trends towards continuous deliver brewing introduced by Faema in 1961. In the 1965, Rancilio commissioned design work from industrial designer Marco Zanuso, beginning with the Rancilio Z8, and continuing with the Z9 in 1974.  Rancilio continued with several Z-series machines, with the Z11 being the last.  The S-series machine would become popular in the 1990s, and become well known in the North American marketplace. [1] In 1997, Rancilio created a home kitchen sized espresso machine based on their commercial offerings. This was initially only available as a thank-you gift to importers and vendors of Rancilio's restaurant-grade coffee machines. This machine was later sold to consumers as the Silvia.[2][3][4] The Silvia is a one group machine with a vibratory pump from ULKA and a single brass boiler that's controlled by 3 thermostats for both steam and hot water. It is frequently sold with its companion Rocky grinder that is available in doserless and dosered models with stepped settings.[5] In 2001, Rancilio revamped their lineup, introducing the basic Epoca, and the Classe series. In 2011, they introduced a new advanced brewing system for the Classe 9 called Xcelsius, which gives precise control of water temperature during the brewing cycle.[6] Rancilio made an attempt at a super-automatic machine, the Classe 12, and used cafes in Borders bookstores as a test market. It was deemed a failure, recalled, and abandoned. They subsequently purchased the Swiss Egro brand of super-automatic machines and have built a presence in that market with their Egro One. In October 2013 Rancilio was acquired by Ali group (an investment fund).[7] Coordinates: 45\u00b031\u203251\u2033N 8\u00b056\u203245\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff45.53083\u00b0N 8.94583\u00b0E\ufeff / 45.53083; 8.94583 ",

It is also one of the leading operators in the advertisement sales & distribution markets. Founded in 1927 by entrepreneur Angelo Rizzoli as A. Rizzoli & C., it started in the press industry by buying out four national magazines, and later entering the publishing industry. Restructured and taken over a number of times, particularly in the 1980s when two of its executives became involved in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano and the illegal Masonic Lodge Propaganda Due \u2013 or P2. Following the 1982 death of Roberto Calvi, the group applied for bankruptcy protection and greatly downsized.[2] In 2016, Cairo Communication acquired the controlling stake of RCS MediaGroup. In the same year, Italian Competition Authority approved the sales of RCS Libri (a.k.a. Rizzoli Libri) from RCS MediaGroup to Arnoldo Mondadori Editore.[3] The timeline of the company:[4] RCS MediaGroup's sectors include newspapers, magazines and books, radio broadcasting, the internet and digital and satellite TV; it also has a division which handles advertising sales & distribution markets across all media divisions.

It is the leading company in Italy for the acquisition of advertising for print media, for which it has a market share of 19%.[20] RCS Libri runs the group's activities in the book publishing sector. Its structure comprises four divisions: RCS Libri Italia, RCS Education, RCS Partworks, and Rizzoli USA.[21] The whole division was sold to Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, with some imprints were sold to other investors.[22][23][24] After the transaction, RCS Libri was renamed to Rizzoli Libri.[25] It owned the rights to use the brand Rizzoli in book publishing only.[22] The partworks division was sold in 2011.[26] Publishing houses[27]     On 26 January 2005 shareholders which control 63.527% of ordinary share capital came to a shareholders' agreement freezing, the participants from selling or trading their holdings.[citation needed] On 14 March 2008 the pact agreed to extend their agreement for another three years until 2011.[29] Italmobiliare, a company in the pact, acquired 2.332% stake of RCS from their subsidiary Italcementi in 2010, making the stake held by Italmobiliare increased to 7.465%.[30] Italmobiliare did not excised all of their rights in the capital increase, making the company owned just 3.0042% of the share capital and 3.7469% ordinary shares of RCS.[31] In 2016 Urbano Cairo, via Cairo Communication, successfully completed a hostile takeover of RCS MediaGroup. However, Mediobanca, Unipol, Pirelli, Diego Della Valle and a private equity fund International Acquisitions Holding[32] formed a new shareholders pact that opposed to Cairo;[33] their offer to the public was lost to the offer from Cairo. Earlier that year, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), a company of the 2008 pact, distributed the shares of RCS the company owns (16.7% of the share capital), to the shareholders of FCA,[34] making the shareholders of FCA freely decided to sell the shares of RCS to either factions or kept the shares as their own investments; Exor, the major shareholder of FCA, sold the stake of RCS immediately.[35] As of 26 September 2016[36] ",

The group operates in several fields worldwide through its subsidiaries: Rizzani was established in Udine, Italy in 1831. Over the following century, Rizzani developed its presence in Italy and ventured in several countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In 1948 Riccardo De Eccher established the company bearing his name in the northern Italian region of Trentino Alto Adige engaging in real estate development. In 1970 Riccardo De Eccher takes over Rizzani. Ten years later, the construction of two segments of the Carnia-Tarvisio motorway marked the acquisition of technologies for prefabrication and launching of overhead bridges. These technologies will be constantly developed over the successive years and finally consolidated into Deal S.r.l., a group affiliate specialized in advanced bridge construction technologies. In 1982 the first important overseas project of Rizzani De Eccher was acquired - five schools in Algeria. In 1984 five landmark projects were acquired in what was then the Soviet Union, becoming the first registered Western contractor in the Soviet Union, and marking the beginning of a successful expansion in Russia.

(acronym of Societ\u00e0 Anonima Fabbrica Italiana Lavorazione Occhiali) is an Italian company that designs, produces and distributes prescription frames, sunglasses, sports eyewear, ski goggles and helmets, and cycling helmets under its own five house brands and 32 licensed brands. Their products are primarily manufactured in three Italian facilities with an additional plant in Slovenia, one in United States and one in China,[3] and are marketed in 130 countries worldwide.[4] As of 2012[update], it was the second largest optical frame and sunglasses company[5] after Luxottica. It was in 1878 that a manufacturing site was first opened to produce lenses and frames in Calalzo di Cadore, in the Venetian Alps. The Safilo name dates back to 1934, when Guglielmo Tabacchi bought this first Italian production site and founded a new eyewear company, making it the oldest player in the Italian eyewear industry.[6] In the 1930s, exports expanded to many European countries, North Africa, the Middle East and South America. During the second world war, Safilo was forced to produce only one type of eyewear, a celluloid frame in two colours, amber and reddish Havana brown, that were all sent to Germany. After the war, exports to other European nations resumed and operations expanded to Rome and Milan with exports beginning in the United States. In 1974, the founder of Safilo died and his sons took over running the business. In the 1970s, Safilo opened sales offices in various European nations, patented the Elasta hinge, and introduced a popular UFO model of sunglasses.[7] In the 1980s, Safilo developed designer collections and gained full control of American eyewear company Starline Optical Corp. He subsequently acquired then sunglass-maker Friuli-based Oxsol and listed Safilo on the Milan Stock Exchange. In the 1990s, Safilo entered the Asian market in Hong Kong, opened branches in more European nations, South Africa, Japan and Brazil, acquired American sports eyewear maker Smith Sports Optics, Inc, and Austria's Carrera Optyl. In May 2001, Safilo Chairman Vittorio Tabacchi began a takeover bid in which he acquired full ownership of Safilo. The company returned to the Milan Stock Exchange in December 2005. Also in 2001, the company inaugurated its new centralized warehouse at its Padua headquarters, a state-of-the-art structure with highly automated facilities. At this point, the distribution platform consisted of three main centres, located in Padua; Denver, Colorado; and Hong Kong. In 2002, Safilo acquired the Solstice Sunglasses chain in US. In 2008 and 2009, Hal Holding NV increased its ownership to 37.23% of the company.[5] In January 2018, Safilo Group launched luxury eyewear collections along with Elie Saab Couture and Oxydo brands.[8] Safilo owns its private collection about the history of eyewear and of the company.[9] The core Safilo brands are:.[10] Safilo's full year 2017 total net sales of Euro 1,047.0 million decreased 16.4% at current exchange rates and 15.5% at constant exchange rates compared to Euro 1,252.9 million in the full year 2016. In the year, wholesales revenues equaled Euro 981.7 million, down 16.7% at current exchange rates and 15.8% at constant exchange rates compared to Euro 1,177.8 million in 2016. The net sales of the Going Forward Brand Portfolio decreased by 3.9% at constant exchange rates (-3.9% excl. retail).[11] For the fiscal year 2014, revenues at Safilo stood at 1,178.7 million euros (1,277.8 million dollars) representing a 5.1 percent rise against 2013, and revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 11.2 percent against the fourth quarter of 2013.[12] In the first quarter of 2015, the turnover of Safilo in Europe was up 2.6 percent or over 2.8 percent at constant exchange rates.[13] In 2010, the Safilo Group's revenues were up 6.8% over 2009, with net sales at \u20ac1,079.9 million or \u20ac1.1 billion.[5] Sales have been determined by prescription frames (38%), sunglasses (54.3%) and sport and other products (7.7%). Safilo's products are primarily sold to wholesale clients through approximately 1000,000 points of sale in about 130 countries in the world.[14] ",

(Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[sa\u02c8lini impre\u02c8d\u0361\u0292i\u02d0lo]) is an Italian industrial group specialised in the construction and civil engineering business headquartered in Milan. The company was formally founded in 2014 as the result of the merger by incorporation of Salini into Impregilo. Salini Impregilo is the largest Italian engineering and general contractor group and a global player in the construction sector. The Group is active in over 50 countries of 5 continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) with 35,000 employees. Its experience ranges from the construction of dams, hydroelectric plants and hydraulic structures, water infrastructures and ports, to roads, motorways, railways, metro systems and underground works, to airports, hospitals and public and industrial buildings, to civil engineering for waste-to-energy plants and environmental protection initiatives. It takes first place in the water sector of the Engineering News-Record rankings, the benchmark for the entire construction industry.[2] Salini Impregilo is listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.  It is directed by Pietro Salini. The company was founded as Impregilo in 1959 and expanded following a merger with Cogefar-Impresit S.p.A., Girola S.p.A. and Lodigiani S.p.A. in 1990.[3] In 2011 Salini, privately held, began its acquisition of Impregilo with an initial purchase of shares, reaching 25% the following year. The acquisition set a precedent in Italy because it was the first proxy fight for control of a company to occur in the country. Despite the opposition it faced from a group of investors, Salini managed to convince enough shareholders at an assembly in July 2012 to approve its proposal to replace Impregilo\u2019s board of directors with its own list of candidates. Once in place, these new members of the board approved Salini\u2019s offer to buy the rest of Impregilo. Pietro Salini became chief executive. A few months later, the board approved Salini\u2019s plan.[4] In 2013, Salini launched a tender offer to buy the remaining ordinary shares in Impregilo. In January 2014 the transaction was completed forming Salini Impregilo.[5] On December 18, 2018, Marco Bucci, the mayor of Genoa and commissioner overseeing the reconstruction of the bridge over the Polcevera River announced the selection of Salini Impregilo and Fincantieri Infrastructure, via a new company called PERGENOVA, for the reconstruction of the bridge according to a design by Renzo Piano.[6][7][8] Salini Impregilo undertakes the following types of works: dams, hydroelectric power plants, railways, tunnels, undergrounds, bridges, viaducts, highways, roads, ports, airports and prestigious residential and office complexes.[9] The Group operates in more than 50 countries on 5 continents and has 35,000 employees. It is organised into four business areas: Dams, hydroelectric plants and hydraulic works; Motorways and airports; Railways and undergrounds; Civil and industrial buildings.[10] With more than a century of engineering experience among the two founding companies of Salini Impregilo, the group\u2019s track record includes 257 dams and hydroelectric plants; 6,830 kilometres (4,240 miles) of railway lines; 1,450 kilometres (900 miles) of underground works, 400 of which subway lines; 51,660 kilometres (32,100 miles) of roads and highways; and 350 bridges and viaducts.[11] Projects in which Salini Impregilo has been involved include buildings, public utilities, motorways, underground works, airports, water supply systems, waste disposals, hospitals and land development. Some major examples include: Salini Impregilo is also working on the Gotthard Base Tunnel. The Group is also leading a consortium for Red Line North, a part of the Doha Metro project in Qatar, which is expected to be completed in 2019.[35] The Salini Impregilo Board of Directors is as follows:[36] ",

It specializes in shoes,[2] leather goods, Swiss-made timepieces, and ready-to-wear for men and women.  The company licences eyewear and watches. It is the parent company of the Ferragamo Group which employs about 4,000 persons and maintains a network of over 685 mono-brand stores, and it runs operations in Italy and worldwide. Salvatore Ferragamo emigrated from southern Italy to the US, first to Boston and then California in 1914. He opened the Hollywood Boot Shop in 1923 and made shoes[2] for movie stars such as Joan Crawford and Gloria Swanson, as well as for films such as Cecil B. DeMille's feature film The Ten Commandments.[3] He returned to Italy and set up a shoe shop in Florence in 1927.[4] The current shoemaking company regards 1928 as the date of its foundation, however, and it therefore celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2008.[3] Salvatore Ferragamo filed for bankruptcy in 1933,[citation needed] during the Great Depression, but by 1938 he was in a position to buy the Palazzo Spini Feroni, one of the great palaces of Florence.[3] This houses the company's flagship store and a museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work. The company flourished after World War II, expanding the workforce to 700 craftsmen producing 350 pairs of handmade shoes a day.[citation needed] After Salvatore's death in 1960, his widow Wanda took over the running of the business and expanded its operations to include eyewear, perfume, belts, scarves,[4]  bags, watches, and a ready to wear clothing line. The company's majority owners remain the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives.[5] There is a rule that only three members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition.[5] To ease these tensions, in September 2006, the family announced a plan to float 48% of the company on the stock market, and since October 2006 Michele Norsa has served as managing and general director.[4] However, as of January 2008, this plan may be on put on hold in the midst of the downturn in the financial market.[6] If the listing on the stock market proceeds, the fund will be directed primarily towards building its positions in China.[7] The company is holding its 80th birthday exhibition in Shanghai.[3] In 2011 the company was listed on the stock exchange.[8] As of December 31, 2016, the Salvatore Ferragamo Group's retail network consisted of 402 directly operated stores (DOS), while the wholesale and travel retail channel included 281 third party operated stores (TPOS), as well as presence in major department stores and high-end multi-brand specialty stores.[9] As of 31 December 2017, the Group's Retail network counted on a total of 685 points of sales, including 410 Directly Operated Stores (DOS) and 275 Third Party Operated Stores (TPOS). As of 31 December 2018, the Group's Retail network counted on a total of 672 points of sales,including 409 Directly Operated Stores (DOS) and 263 Third Party Operated Stores (TPOS). On August 2, 2016 Eraldo Poletto was appointed as new CEO of the group. On March 8, 2017 conclusion of the relation with Poletto granted interim management powers to the Chairman, Ferruccio Ferragamo. On July 31, 2018 Micaela le Divelec is appointed as new CEO of the group. Throughout its history, the company has been known for innovative designs and use of materials.  Such ingenuity goes back to Salvatore's time in California, when he studied anatomy to make shoes which were more comfortable. Notable innovations include the wedge heel, the shell-shaped sole, the \u2018invisible\u2019 sandal, metal heels and soles, the 18-carat gold sandal, the sock-shoe, sculpture heels, and the gloved arch shoe created for the Maharani of Cooch Behar in 1938.[3] Metal-reinforced stiletto heels were made famous by Marilyn Monroe.[4] The company is also known for the \u2018Gancini\u2019 decoration, the \u2018Vara\u2019 patent ballet pump, the Salvatore bag and the use of patchwork.[3] It makes also eyewear and watches in partnership with Marchon and Timex Group. Salvatore worked with film stars and celebrities from his earliest days in Hollywood. Clients over the years included Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Greta Garbo,[4] as well as Andy Warhol, Lil Uzi Vert, Grace Mugabe and Diana, Princess of Wales.[3]  The company made Margaret Thatcher's famous handbags[7] and for King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck during the coronation on November 6, 2008 in Thimpu, Bhutan.

Sanpellegrino S.p.A. has been part of Swiss company Nestl\u00e9 since 1997 and its products are exported to most countries in Europe, the Americas, Australasia and the Middle East, as well as in Asia in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Sanpellegrino Company has ten production sites in Italy[1] including its headquarters. More than 1,850 people work in the company. It also manages other brands like Vera, Levissima and Acqua Panna, and its revenue, according to the balance sheet of the year 2016, amounts to 895 million euros,[2] about 96 million euros less than the previous year.[3] 50,000 bottles of water are produced every hour in the San Pellegrino plant, for a total amount of one million bottles a day including soft drinks, sparkling water and cocktails. The bottles are then sorted to be exported to major countries around the world. In 2005, five hundred million bottles were sold globally. In 2017, that number had increased to one billion bottles.[4] S.Pellegrino mineral water is produced in San Pellegrino Terme. The water may originate from a layer of rock 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) below the surface, where it is mineralized from contact with limestone and volcanic rocks. The springs are located at the foot of a dolomite mountain wall which favours the formation and replenishment of a mineral water basin. The water then seeps to depths of over 700\u00a0m (2,300\u00a0ft) and flows underground to a distant aquifer. The water from the spring is not naturally carbonated; rather, gas is added prior to packaging. The water from this spring is only used for the natural product, and is not used for any of the flavored varieties.[5] S.Pellegrino mineral water has been produced for over 620 years.[6] In 1395, the town borders of San Pellegrino were drawn, marking the start of its water industry. Leonardo da Vinci is said to have visited the town in 1509 to sample and examine the town's miraculous water, later writing a treatise on water.[6]  Analysis shows that the water is strikingly similar to the samples taken in 1782, the first year such analysis took place. In fact, doctors from Northern Italy in the 13th Century used to suggest that their patients go to the Val Brembana spring for treatment.[7] Over the years, its therapeutic properties attracted many visitors, and, at the beginning of 1900, San Pellegrino Terme became a holiday resort with a casino, thermal baths and a hotel.[8] In 1794 a treatise mentioned S.Pellegrino water as a treatment method for kidney stone disease.[9] In 1839, S.Pellegrino water was recommended for people affected with kidney diseases and urinary tract infection.[10] In 1760, Pellegrino Foppoli built a bathhouse where visitors had to pay a fee to use the indoor facilities.[11] In 1803, Foppoli's descendants sold the bathhouse to Giovanni Pesenti who wanted to construct a larger building.[12] The town council feared that this project would prevent visitors from free use of the spring. For this reason, they filed a complaint with the prefect which led Ester Pesenti and Lorenzo Palazzolo to sign an agreement in 1831. They decided that the 24 unit spring would be divided into two. So that, 17 units were given to Pesenti and Palazzolo and 7 units to San Pellegrino Terme town council. In 1834, the flood of the Brembo, the river that crosses San Pellegrino Terme, caused serious damage in the valley.[13] Since the restoration required huge expenses, in 1837 the town leased Pesenti and Palazzolo its share of the water for 12 years. In 1841, Ester Pesenti requested an authorization to continue to expand the bathhouse.[14] One year later, another flood hit the valley and San Pellegrino Terme sold three-quarters of its shares to Pesenti. Since the water had always been connected to the territory, they agreed to give the remaining quarter of the shares to the residents of the town who still can use an external tap free of charge.[15] The construction work finished in 1846. When Queen Margherita visited the town in 1905,[16] many articles appeared on the Giornale di San Pellegrino, in which it was illustrated that the bottled mineral water was sold in the main Italian cities, in many cities around Europe, as well as in Cairo, Tangiers, Shanghai, Calcutta, Sydney, Brazil, Peru, and the United States. One case of 50 bottles cost 26 Italian lire, while a case of 24 bottles cost 14 Italian lire. At the beginning of the 20th century, carbon dioxide was added to S.Pellegrino to prevent the development of bacteria, especially during long overseas travels. It is still taken from sources in Tuscany and sent to San Pellegrino Terme.[17] The spa facilities were renovated, and in 1928, they were equipped with more modern tools for various diagnostic needs, such as the radioscopic and radiograph room and the microscopic and chemical analysis laboratory.[6] In addition, Granelli reorganized the bottling plant with new equipment, which moved up to a production capacity of 120,000 bottles a day. At the beginning, it was a handmade production, then it became gradually mechanized and was managed by an all female staff. The first machinery was introduced in 1930 and, since that moment, the amount produced has been increasing. Subsequently, the company began a packaging process for shipping to the recipient countries.[18] In 1961, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. started to produce bottled mineral water and other beverages in the new San Pellegrino Terme factory. In 1932, the Aranciata orangeade variant was introduced. Containing S.Pellegrino as its primary ingredient, the soda added concentrated orange juice. Today, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. also produces various other flavors of carbonated beverages: Limonata (lemonade), Sanbitt\u00e8r (bitters), Pompelmo (grapefruit), Aranciata Rossa (blood orange), and Chin\u00f2 (chinotto). In 1968, S.Pellegrino appeared on the front cover of the British Sunday newspaper The Observer. During the Italian Occupation of Ethiopia production was curtailed in its entirety for the Italian military water needs. During this time they advocated for the policy changes Mussolini's government had been implementing. This increased revenue dramatically for several years, even after the occupation had faltered. Over the years, the bottling lines increased the production levels needed to satisfy the needs of a market which was becoming more and more sophisticated, and in 2012 a high speed PET bottling line was installed.[19] The company built a new plant some kilometers beyond the previous one as the water production continued to grow. On April 20, 1970 the water company changed its name from Societ\u00e0 Anonima Delle Terme di S.Pellegrino to Sanpellegrino S.p.A.[20] In the early seventies, it was decided to no longer use mineral water in the production of soft drinks, and to substitute it with spring water which was treated with particular equipment. In 1997, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. was bought by Perrier Vittel SA, a division of Nestl\u00e9 which also owned the Perrier and Vittel bottled water brands.[21] In Italy, S.Pellegrino is available in 1.5 L bottles for about one euro, the same for their Aranciata in most stores. Competitive orange drinks can cost even less. If artificial sweeteners are used, the price is about half that of the sugared varieties. Paolo Luni, who joined the company as a consultant, then became General Manager and eventually CEO, left the company in 1999 after having inaugurated the Sanpellegrino Centennial celebrations, which took place in Teatro La Scala in Milan. The company now became the complete property of Nestl\u00e9 Group.[22] In May 2014, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. released two new flavors of their Sparkling Fruit Beverages. The new flavors were Melograno e Arancia (Pomegranate and Orange) and Clementina (Clementine). They were announced through an installation at Eataly's La Scuola Grande in New York where large cans of the new soda flavors were constructed out of flowers. The bottles' packaging has maintained the original references to its territory and its first productions.[23] The products on the market can be divided into two categories: glass and PET.[24] The shape of the glass bottles has remained the same since its origin in 1899. The model is called Vichy because at that time San Pellegrino Terme was known as \"the Italian Vichy\",[25] and it is characterized by the elongated shape of the bottle. The red star was a symbol of high quality products exported from Italy between the 1800s and the 1900s.[26] On the neck of the bottle there is a representation of the Casino, the date of the foundation of the brand and the company. The label has a white and blue watermark, which recalls the Belle Epoque style. The PET line has the same shape of the glass bottles. The production started at the end of the 1990s with the aim of maintaining the same perlage and effervescence of the glass line. At the beginning, only the 50 centiliters size was produced, but since 2006, the production of the 33, 75 and 100 centilitre bottles were added to the original one.[27] Different versions of the label were created for collaborations, partnerships and international events.  In 2010, 2011 and 2013 the project \"S.Pellegrino Meets Italian Talents\" was meant to create collaborations with Italians known on an international level as a symbol of Italy. These collaborations include Missoni,[28][29] Bulgari[30] and a tribute to Luciano Pavarotti.[31] S.Pellegrino can be seen for the first time in 1949 in the movie The Emperor of Capri, directed by Luigi Comencini and since that moment it has appeared in the following movies and TV series.[34][35] In 2007, the German consumer television program Markt reported that S.Pellegrino contains uranium. Nestl\u00e9 was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water and that the 0.0070mg/l found in their product was below the 0.03\u00a0mg/l threshold established by various governments and food health organizations.[6] S.Pellegrino is not suitable for infants under 12 weeks of age,[39] because their gastrointestinal tract and urinary system is immature and cannot withstand highly mineralized water.[40]  ",

The company was founded in 1962 by Angelo Moratti and is now run by his heirs. The activities of the company have always concentrated in oil refining, which remains the core business of the group; the main production site of the group is the Sarroch refinery, one of six supersites in Europe, situated in a favourable position for the receipt of crude oil and in proximity of the sales of finished products. According to independent oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, based in Edinburgh, the refinery is the one of only six supersites in Europe, with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, representing 15% of refining capacity in Italy. In recent years, initially to enable independence of the Sarroch refinery in terms of energy, the Saras group has entered in the production of electricity; it is also expanding its production of alternative energy sources, particularly in the field of wind energy, through its subsidiaries Sarlux and Sardeolica, the latter of which is indirectly controlled by the company Eolici Ulassai. To date, the Saras group meets more than 30% of the energy needs of Sardinia, with production in 2006 of nearly 4.5 million MWh, of which 157,300 MWh is from wind. Sarlux was born as a joint venture with Enron, but was wholly acquired by Saras on June 28, 2006. The company is listed on the Borsa Italiana (Code ISIN: IT0000433307, Code: SRS, Segment: MTA). In January 2007, the Judiciary launched an investigation against persons unknown on the bid for Public Sale and Exchange which led the company to listing on the Stock Exchange, on complaint of individuals who participated in it; investigations are still ongoing, but the company claims not to have received further communication after the search made in the same month of January. In 2009, the documentary-film by Massimiliano Mazzotta Oil [2] about pollution and low workers security of the refinery was subject to censorship in Italy.       ",

In the first years of its life, S\u00e8leco produced mostly black and white televisions with the Zanussi or Rex brand. The company was put up for sale in 1984, and was acquired by Gian Mario Rossignolo. He first became chairman and then main stockholder. During the 1980s, the company launched worldwide marketing campaigns and began sponsoring some of the most famous Italian soccer teams, such as S.S. Lazio. During the '90s, the company was mainly concentrated on the production of pay-TV decoders, but in 1993 suffered from a loss of competitiveness. With the intent to reshape its position and to get gave new life to the company, Gian Mario Rossignolo bought Brionvega from the Brion family, the founder. This attempt went nowhere, so the company was forced to declare failure in 1997. During the years, S\u00e8leco has passed through ups and downs, and at the end it was overcome by the continuous changes in the electronics world. After the melt-down, the company and all its interests were bought by the Formenti family. This gave rise to the S\u00e8leco-Formenti Group, owner of the rights for the brands S\u00e8leco, Rex, Phonola, Imperial, Stern, Phoenix, Televideon, Kerion and Webrik. The Formenti family re-launched the company with the production of CRT-TVs. In 2000, the company suffered a strong crisis, following the price dumping made by Turkish manufacturers. This led to end of the S\u00e8leco and Brionvega story, as the S\u00e8leco-Formenti Group was forced to liquidation. In 2006, Trademark property were entrusted to Super//Fluo except for the Brionvega brand (bought by Sim2 Multimedia), up to the bankruptcy of company, after which S\u00e8leco went to Selek Technology.  In December 2016, S\u00e8leco was acquired by Twenty S.p.A.,[1] which successively changed its name to S\u00e8leco S.p.A.,[2] moving the company's headquarters and production lines to Trieste.[citation needed] It was revealed that the parent company of S\u00e8leco S.p.A. was owned by Maria Mancini, a woman aged 39.[2] S\u00e8leco also acquired a football club Pro Piacenza in June 2018.[3][4] ",

In July 2003 Finmeccanica and BAE Systems signed a joint venture agreement [5] with the intention merging their avionics, C4ISR and communications businesses to create three joint venture partnerships under the name Eurosystems. The difficulties of integrating the companies in this way however led to a re-evaluation of the proposal. BAE's 2004 Annual Report states that \"recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed ... transaction with Finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model.\"[6] This revised agreement was signed on January 27, 2005.

The brand is renowned for its craftsmanship and feminine designs. The Sergio Rossi label was owned by the French Group Kering until it was sold to Italian buyout firm Investindustrial in December 2015.[1] Riccardo Sciutto is the CEO of Sergio Rossi. Sergio Rossi was born in 1935[2] in the town of San Mauro Pascoli, in the Romagna region of Italy. He inherited from his father, a shoemaker, the tools and the traditions of an artisan.[3] Rossi built his factory in San Mauro Pascoli in 1951,[4] In the early years, he worked through the winter making sandals that he would later sell[5] on the beaches of Rimini and to boutiques in Bologna. One such model, the Opanca[2] was one of the most popular, a simple and daring sandal in which the sole curved gently around the foot, blending with the upper part of the shoe. After a couple of years, the first shoes bearing the Sergio Rossi signature were produced,[2] marking the first official collection of the brand.[6] According to Vogue, during the 1960s, the company, \u201cquickly became synonymous with Italian quality and classic feminine designs.\u201d[7] Sergio Rossi shoes became known for their use of geometrics and color.[8] The brand grew in popularity in the 1970s and beyond, through collaborations with  fashion designers, including Dolce & Gabbana,[3] Versace, and Azzedine Ala\u00efa.[9] Sergio Rossi shoes became a mainstay at the Milan fashion shows. In 1980, the brand began expanding, the first boutique to bear his name opened in Ancona, and then boutiques opening in Turin, Florence, Rome, Brussels, New York City, Los Angeles, and London.[3] The brand also opened a showroom in Milan in 1995.[10] In 1999, PPR Luxury Division, formerly known as Gucci Group, bought a 70% stake in the company for approximately $96 million. 6 years later, in 2005, PPR bought the remaining 30%, retaining full control of the Sergio Rossi brand.[11] In 2015 the company was sold to Investindustrial, the private equity firm that also owns Aston Martin.[6] Francesco Russo was the Creative Director of the brand between 2008 and 2013 when  Angelo Ruggeri became the  design director, holding the position until 2016.[12] In 2016 Andrea Morante became company president and Riccardo Sciutto became Group CEO.[13] In April 2016 the brand started the relaunch with a new marketing and communication strategy paying a great attention to the digital sphere. The new website launched in February 2017 and the communication projects created for the brand social media are the first signs of the new strategy. The launch of the sr1 collection in 2017, was the first step of a new beginning for the Company, taking inspiration from the Sergio Rossi historical archive. sr1 symbolizes of the rebirth, sr represents the respect and the devotion to the history and to the brand heritage, 1 stands for the new beginning. In 2017 the image of the brand undertakes an important refresh, the new packaging and the new store concept embody the distinctive characteristic of the DNA of the brand. Sergio Rossi shoes take a minimum of 120 different steps and 14 hours to create. The Wall Street Journal wrote of the process that, \u201cbuilding a shoe involves high-pressure nail guns, screws, heat-dried glues, sanding, painting, buffing, chiseling, and plenty of loud machinery. Leather and other materials are stretched around the lasts, then nailed, glued and molded in layers.\u201d[14] In 2009, in a move to demonstrate that luxury goods and fashion can be combined with sustainability, Sergio Rossi launched the Eco Pump, a biodegradable fashion shoe made using Liquid Wood (derived from lignin) in the heel and sole, and leather uppers tanned using eco sensitive tanners.[15] In 2015, Sergio Rossi partnered with Eco-Age to develop a Green Carpet Collection of environmentally sustainable wear designs.[16] The iconic product from Sergio Rossi is the Godiva pump. The unique shape is now a signature item of every Sergio Rossi collection, reinvented each season in various materials and colors. The \u201ccachet\u201d silhouette was created by Francesco Russo, for the wedding of Salma Hayek to Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault,[17] CEO of Kering. Sergio Rossi also produces leather handbags,[18] and in 2012 it launched its bridal collection of shoes.[19] Sergio Rossi\u2019s early advertising campaigns were greatly inspired by the work of Helmut Newton, using low-angled shots to highlight the length of the legs and body, and focusing on the height and shape of the heel.[20] In 2012, the company introduced its line with a short-film called Skin to Skin, in collaboration with director Luca Guadagnino.[21]  ",

It provides wireless backhaul and fronthaul solutions that comprise microwave and millimeter wave radio systems, along with fiber optics transmission systems provided by its subsidiary SM Optics. Company products are deployed in more than 90 countries worldwide. The company is headquartered in Milan, Italy, with 26 regional offices around the globe.[1] Edoardo Mascetti, after graduating in 1949 in Electrical Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Milan and working as electronic designer for Siemens, founded his own company and named it SIAE, acronym for Societ\u00e0 Italiana Apparecchiature Elettroniche[2] The company manufactured measurement systems such as electro-mechanical testers, analog oscilloscopes, telephone system analyzers and signal generators. SIAE's sales volume in 1955 was 6.224.000 Italian lire and doubled by the end of 1957. A 431A-model oscilloscope[3] by SIAE was also part of the synthesizer in the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano(RAI) until its dismissal on 1983 and is currently on permanent display with the original study equipment at the Musical Instrument museum hosted at the Castello Sforzesco, Milan.[4] A few years after founding SIAE, Edoardo Mascetti co-founded in 1958 Microelettronica S.p.A., a company whose business was the design of telecommunication equipment for radio and landline systems and which was initially located in a basement in Milan. In 1963, the two complementary companies were merged into SIAE MICROELETTRONICA S.p.A. and the headquarters was moved to the nearby town of Cologno Monzese, where a larger area was available to accommodate the new offices and manufacturing plant.[2] The new company counted less than 50 employees and focused its business on telecommunication systems, which were rising thanks to the capillary diffusion of telephone systems in Italy. Analog multiplexing systems for telephone providers constituted the company's principal product; nonetheless, in 1963, the company began an active collaboration with ENEL, italian provider of electric power, in order to create a supervision system for the national distribution network, whose successful outcome later fostered similar activities in northern Europe and specifically in Norway.[citation needed] By the mid '60s, the company began actively promoting its products by advertising in technical journals as natural consequence of a growing business, thanks to its first large-scale commercialized radio transceiver: the 3-channel 3-B3 and later the RT450 (1966), capable of aggregating 48 channels into UHF band. The RT450 equipment was also certified by it:Telettra under the commercial name H450 as fallback link for its high-capacity solutions. Power-line communication systems were also manufactured by the company in those years along with the first fixed and mobile communication terminals in VHF band (1972) for vehicular communications (precurring modern mobile phones) and anti burglar alarm systems. By 1973, a whole new internal division was created for the design of television broadcasting equipments (repeaters and transmitters) whose main customer was the national television company RAI. The first television products were based on thermo-ionic tubes though the improvement of solid state technologies soon replaced vacuum tubes. Similar improvements in printed board manufacturing made microstrip circuits a viable solution for increasingly-high microwave frequencies and in 1978 the RT12 radio equipment boasted the first direct-conversion 2.3\u00a0GHz synthesized modulator and could aggregate 120 telephone channels. In these years, the company manufactured the historical link to connect the Milan and Rome branches of the Corriere della Sera newspaper.[5] The employees were about a hundred  though the company still remained a family-run business lead by the founder and a tight board of managers through the '70s. Computer-aided design of electronic circuits was approached and exploited to improve yield and reduce the design time especially for the critical high-frequency sections.[6] The early '80s witnessed two intertwined aspects which boosted the activities: the digital revolution reached commercial radio links and the RT20 thus leveraged 4-QAM modulation in order to provide low-capacity links while the increased globalization opened up international markets and the company business expanded to Norway, Great Britain and gradually to Europe. A quality control system was soon implemented to meet and certify the improved production standards. In partnership with then it:Telettra, the Company developed the multi channel radio network covering the national extents, named RIAM, for the national electric company, Enel. The radio equipments were governed by a microprocessor, in the wake of the widespread usage of these new components which offered a huge range of new possibilities for coordinating radio components when compared to traditional dedicated circuits.[2] With the increased demand for traffic, higher frequencies were needed and in the second half of the 80's the company commercialized its 18\u00a0GHz radio transceiver with a capacity up to 2Mbit/s, based on specifications of Enel. A 13\u00a0GHz equipment with 4Mbit/s was instead first provided to the Mercury operator in the UK. Thin film manufacturing techniques for printed circuit boards were adopted during the 80s by the company for its microwave products beyond 10\u00a0GHz with ad-hoc equipments and production lines (yellow room) and soon upgraded to chip-and-wire technologies in white rooms (clean room). Documents show the RT28 transceiver remained in service until 2008 in the Italian Aosta Valley.[7] In 1986 the Company introduced the \"split-mount\" configuration, where an indoor unit (IDU) is connected to an outdoor unit ODU. The IDU provides the network interfaces and carries out the baseband tasks while communicates with the ODU, usually by means of an intermediate frequency, which is tasked of radio frequency up/down conversion and is connected to the antenna. The split-mount configuration is still currently in use in several modern radio products and the boost in sales at that time was recognized in the 1988 edition of Major Companies of Europe.[8] In the early '90s the diffusion of data services and SDH required higher capacities to be transported and in 1992 the Company provided its HS13 SDH equipment to the SIP telephone company (later become Telecom Italia) entering thus the market of high-capacity microwave radio links and introducing enhanced techniques to counteract non-idealities in the communication channel and the transceiver hardware.[9][10] Simultaneously, subsidiaries were opened in Latin America and Far East. To meet international standards for control and supervision of the increasingly complex networks of radio links, the Company developed its own Network management system providing a unified interface for all its products. One of the first versions of monitoring software was still in use as of 2012 for a it:TETRA network.[11] In the meantime, the production of television transmitters and repeaters was halted in order to focus the activities towards the core business of backhauling radio links. The increased volume of chip and wire components fostered the introduction of improved Cleanrooms, upgraded to the 10'000 class. The Company further evolved internally to expand its business and offer the services surrounding the mere provision of hardware, such as network planning, assistance, installation and contributed to the activities of international standardization bodies.[12] In the late 90s the Company commercialized a family of products whose design was dedicated to the booming market of GSM cellular mobile communications. In 1999, the offer was expanded to support high-capacity SDH traffic and a number of multiplexing equipments were developed as well to address the increased complexity and demanded flexibility of network configurations and interfaces. The Twenty-first century was inaugurated by the first direct collaboration and commercial relationships with China which in 2014 lead to a dedicated subsidiary, Siae Telecommunications Shenzhen Limited.[13] The first european subsidiary opened in 2002 in Paris while the first non-european branch initiated activities in 2006 in Bangkok. The production and assembly processes began transitioning from manual to automatic SMT placement equipment in the early 2000s to cope with a volume of 15'000 radios/year while the yearly sales in 2002 increased by 25.8%.[14] In partnership with Cisco, the Company developed algorithms and dedicated implementations for adaptive bandwidth and adaptive modulation schemes, which allow to react to impaired communication conditions (such as rain) gracefully reducing the link throughput instead of temporarily suspending the communication (out of service). Such solutions, extensively relied upon for network planning, are currently standard in most modern point-to-point radio links for backhauling.[15] In the wake of the global migration from circuit switching towards IP packet networks, the Company developed Full IP equipments in split-mount and full-outdoor versions and also dual native radios, supporting both TDM and Ethernet modes, whose popularity positively affected company's sales volume. To meet the ever-increasing demand for higher throughput without need for additional bandwidth, which is licensed at a price in most dedicated bands, frequency reuse dominated subsequent industrial developments and the adoption of dual-polarization techniques was commercially proposed in 2007, when the company and Vodafone (Omnitel by that time) presented the paper \"2xSTM1 frequency reuse system with XPIC\" at the European Conference on Fixed Wireless Network Technologies 2007 in Paris.[16] Thanks to Full IP and XPIC equipment sales, the yearly production of radios hit 70'000 in 2011 while the sales income topped 180 million Euro [17] and by the end of 2012 the number of people employed by the company exceeded 1000 over the 25 world branches, about 700 of which located in the Cologno Monzese headquarters.[18] The juridical literature reports of a litigation initiated in 2006 by NEC Corporation against SIAE Microelettronica over alleged infringement of several former's patents in the courts of Milan and Munich. The case was closed in 2010 with a bilateral agreement to withdraw all infringement, nullity and opposition actions pending worldwide.[19][20][21] Although not directly involved in antenna manufacturing, the Company and Polytechnic University of Milan patented in 2011 a dielectric antenna for mm-wave communications based on a novel design aimed at reducing the overall size, whose application targeted small form factor radio equipments.[22] The visual impact of transceivers began in those years to earn importance for the deployment of urban links, where the existing environment should be affected as little as possible by access stations and backhauling  transceivers with their antennas. In 2013 the company entered the millimeter-wave market with its full-outdoor transceivers in E-Band. In 2014, the product portfolio included also V band radios for small cell backhaul and NLOS solutions for urban communications which may benefit from exploiting reflections on buildings in order to increase coverage. A new network monitoring software was also released in 2014 to offer enhanced features to network operators for managing and evaluating aggregated performances, which are gaining more and more relevance as key figures in the assessment of traffic bottlenecks and overall behavior of a complex network.[23][24] In 2014 the labs for the management system for terrestrial networks and two families of equipment for fiber optic telecommunications\u2014OMSN (Optical Multi-Service Node) and TSS (Transport Service Switch)\u2014 were transferred from Alcatel Lucent (now Nokia) to a new dedicated company, SM Optics, a subsidiary of SIAE Microelettronica.[25][26][27][28][29][30] From 2014 to 2016, through its entirely owned company \"Twist-off\" in Padua (Italy), Siae Microelettronica was active in researching applications of Orbital Angular Momentum of light (OAM) communications applied to long-distance links.[31][32][33][34] Field tests of the principles were also published [35][36][37] and filed under an industrial patent [38] based on the twisted parabola.[39] As a means to increase capacity and frequency reuse orbital angular momentum multiplexing was also compared to traditional MIMO spatial multiplexing techniques in terms of antenna size/spacing/occupation and achievable performance, which resulted in a critical assessment showing that both have equal performances.[40] Near field properties of OAM beams at microwaves have also been investigated[41][42][43] resulting in valid theoretical and practical demonstrations to lay the ground for short-range secure communications with application to contactless payments and transactions, filed under a dedicated patent.[44] The company continues its long standing cooperation strategy with research institutions and in 2015 it joined the Laurea Magistrale Plus program,[45] promoted by University of Pavia for Master's degree achieved with an extended and close participation in existing companies' activities.[46] In 2016 the company presented, at the Mobile World Congress, Layer-3 VPN services over microwave radio links using SM-OS, based on Software-defined networking (SDN).[47][48] In 2016, an internal team of researchers coauthored the \"Receiver\", \"Modem\" and \"Antenna\" chapters in a comprehensive book describing electronic design of transceiver frontends for backhauling.[49] In 2017 the Company became a technological partner of Vodafone for the 5G project.  The Company enabled the interconnection of 5G Base Stations through 10 Gbit/s microwave radio links ALFOplus80HDX in the Metropolitan area of Milan.  Italian Ministry of Economic Development evaluated Vodafone's 5G experimental project with the highest rating.\"[50] Logo of the newborn SIAE (Societ\u00e0 Italiana Apparecchiature Elettroniche) company in 1952.

After World War I it gained the name Savoia, when it acquired the Societ\u00e0 Anonima Costruzioni Aeronautiche Savoia, an Italian aircraft company founded by Umberto Savoia in 1915. The name Marchetti was added when chief designer Alessandro Marchetti joined the company in 1922. Savoia-Marchetti gained prominence with the successful S.55 flying boat. Savoia-Marchetti became famous for its flying boats and seaplanes, which set numerous endurance and speed records. Favoured by Air Marshal Italo Balbo, the company began rapidly prototyping and developing a number of other aircraft, increasingly focusing on warplanes in the lead-up to World War II. However, most of S.M.'s manufacturing capabilities were destroyed in World War Two. It was renamed SIAI-Marchetti in 1943. SIAI-Marchetti only survived in postwar Italy by building trucks and railway equipment.[citation needed] However it still struggled with insolvency for six years after the war before declaring bankruptcy in September 1951, with all staff being dismissed, although more than half were re-employed by the liquidator to complete existing orders.[1] In 1953, the company reopened. It began to focus increasingly on helicopters in the 1970s and was eventually purchased by the aerospace firm Agusta in 1983.  ",

In 2018 Leadiant Biosciences has come under fire for creating a monopoly for CDCA and unnecessarily increasing the price with a factor of 335.[2] Construction began in 1964 of an industrial facility in Pomezia equipped with state-of-the-art automatic production machinery to provide steady employment for 64 people. The choice of Pomezia for its headquarters created one of the first industrialization and urban development initiatives in an area of Central-southern Italy that had previously been mainly devoted to agriculture. With the creation and launch of the Rekord B12 vitamin complex in September 1966 \u2013 an antiasthenic medicine that soon spread within the field of restorative infantile therapies \u2013 Sigma-Tau definitively asserted itself as a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Italy and abroad. From the 1970s onwards, Sigma-Tau focused on experimenting with new medicines for rare diseases \u2013 a commitment that in 1984 would cause it to become the fourth largest pharmaceutical company in the world and assignee in the United States of an Orphan Drug Designation,[3] subsequently receiving another seven.  With the discovery in the 1970s of Carnitine deficiency syndromes. (Q37923366), an illness with a fatal outcome, Sigma-Tau focused the investigative efforts of its laboratories on research into a molecule capable of opposing the disease. This was to bring about the creation of L-carnitine, one of the few Italian pharmaceutical products widely received outside Italy, and which was recognized by the United States in 1984 for its value as a life saving medicine. The chemical and biologic pharmacology study of carnitine, a substance of natural origin, enabled greater understanding of its efficacy in correcting the biochemical and metabolic defects at the base of numerous other pathologies. Fondazione Sigma-Tau was created in 1986 as a charitable organization with the aim of developing research, promoting scientific and cultural progress and the safeguarding of the results of scientific investigation. The Sigma-Tau Group achieved a corporate turnover of 697 million euro in 2013, employs a workforce of 1,919 and possesses a portfolio of more than 100 products marketed in Italy and abroad, with regards to the following therapeutic areas: Cardiometabolic disorders, Orthopedic and Rheumatologic diseases, Broncho-Pneumology, Infectology, Oncology, Neurology, Gastroenterology, Dermatology, Urology and Gynecology, Malaria and Rare Diseases. The Group is a leader in the nutraceutics industry and produces supplements of high scientific interest. Its product range also includes high-end dermocosmetics lines, as well as oral and personal care products. Since 1998 it has filed 297 patents confirming itself, among the national Italian owned, as a major player in the registration of new molecules or important technological innovations. The Sigma-Tau Group has headquarters in Pomezia (Rome, Italy), and subsidiaries in France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, UK, India, and with production plant in Italy as well as in Spain and US (Indianapolis). The ability to expand its presence on the international stage, mainly through the activation of collaborative research with numerous scientific institutions in America, Europe and Asia, is the key to Sigma-Tau\u2019s future. Since the pioneering studies conducted by its founder Claudio Cavazza, Sigma-Tau has always proved to be a groundbreaker in the discovery of drugs for rare and orphan diseases: for instance, Carnitine for the treatment of primary or secondary \u201cspecific deficiencies\u201d was the second product ever to obtain the designation as \u201corphan drug\u201d by the US FDA. Leveraging this background, the company has confirmed its commitment to developing drugs with orphan indications over the years and has acquired Enzon\u2019s \u201cspeciality pharma\u201d portfolio. With eight products for the treatment of rare and neglected diseases, today Sigma-Tau is a pharmaceutic player acting in the forefront in the treatment of Rare Diseases. The goal of its recently created Global Rare Disease Business Unit is to contribute to the progresses in the knowledge, diagnosis and treatment of Rare Diseases. Sigma-Tau in collaboration with the non-profit organization Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) has developed a new medicine for the treatment of malaria a fixed combination consisting of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine, judged to be one of the most effective antimalaria medicines available and the best combination containing artemisinin. The registration dossier was presented on July 3, 2009 in Europe (EMEA)and approved in 2011. The new drug has obtained the registration in Cambodia, Ghana and Tanzania and is started in Burkina Faso, Mozambique and other key African endemic countries. Sigma-Tau is the main element of a group in which other companies operate, in accordance with the prospects of the corporate development plan. Founded in 1982 and active both in the pharmaceutical market and that of consumer products sold in pharmacies. Avantgarde has developed its business within the dermatological, gynaecological and paediatric sectors; for consumer products the focus is geared to dermocosmetic sector and to oral hygiene with OTC products. Incorporated in 1979 as part of the Sigma-Tau Group, Biosint is currently a world-leading producer of L-Carnitine derived by chemical synthesis. The company manufactures and distributes active pharmaceutical ingredients, lactic ferments and nutraceutical products obtained by chemical synthesis and fermentation. Its operations are carried out in full compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), at establishments approved by FDA and main domestic and international Regulatory Authorities. Biofutura was founded in 2001 with the objective of developing pharmaceutical products in the cure of diseases of the central nervous system and respiratory system. Activity also spread to the development and marketing of products derived from the carnitine biological system. Responsible for the research and development of substances active on important areas of treatment including oncology and immunology and on diseases that are rare, neglected and with high social impact. Responsible for the clinical development of Sigma-Tau products in the United States. A recently established research centre that co-ordinates research and development activity relating to selected products and provides clinical development and chemical analytical expertise. While the company claims to operate in absolute respect of ethical principles and existing legislation it received a tremendous amount of negative attention due their action to increase the price of an orphan drug to such extent it became impossible to pay for the drug.[2] In 1967 Sigma-Tau became equipped with a water conditioning plant. Since 2005, the commitment to reduce impact on the environment in the elimination of solvents in aid of water in many preparations has produced continuing reduction in CO2 emissions that have fallen from 5,932 tons to 5,587 in 2007. Since 2007, Sigma-Tau has begun waste sorting and choosing eco-compatible materials. In the same year, in which Sigma-Tau\u2019s environmental costs amounted to around 600,000 euros, a reduction of 8% in the quantity of industrial wastewater was confirmed. The Pharmaceutical Accountability Foundation accused the company of abusing its dominant market position when it increased the price of chenodeoxycholic acid from \u20ac0.28 per capsule to \u20ac140 per capsule in 2018. They said  \u201cThis may be legal but it\u2019s not socially acceptable.\u201d They said they would make a referral to the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets. [4][2] Over the years, Sigma-Tau has developed numerous partnerships, formed with associations and bodies engaged \u2013 at national and international level \u2013 in projects and activities with a social emphasis, with particular focus on the areas of health and social welfare. The company also provides its medicines free-of-charge to around 40 national and international organizations operating in conflict and post-conflict contexts to support those people stricken by natural disasters and famine.  At international level, Sigma-Tau: At national level: Sigma and Tau are the two stars that flank Antares at the centre of the Scorpius constellation. Arabs considered the red Antares the heart of the constellation and therefore regarded the bright stars positioned beside it \u2013 Sigma Scorpii and Tau Scorpii \u2013 as the arteries leading away from the heart, as indicated by the term that describes them both (Al Niyat, meaning the arteries).

Vittorio Bertazzoni founded the company in 1948 in the town of Guastalla, Reggio Emilia, Italy. The name is an acronym for Smalterie Metallurgiche Emiliane Guastalla (\"Emilian metallurgical enamel works of Guastalla\"). The company remains in the private ownership of the Bertazzoni family with its headquarters still in Guastalla. Smeg is best known for its FAB range of 1950s-style, retro refrigerators that have curved corners and come in a variety of non-traditional colors and patterns. The company also manufactures dishwashers (freestanding - available in FAB style, semi-integrated and fully integrated), washing machines, ovens, microwaves, cooktops, freestanding cookers, rangehoods, refrigeration, wine cabinets, in-built coffee machines and small domestic appliances.[citation needed] Vittorio Bertazzoni Snr founded Smeg in 1948.  The company originally specialised in enamelling and metalwork.  It soon began to produce innovative cooking appliances.  \"Elisabeth\", launched in 1956, was one of the first gas ranges to feature automatic ignition, safety valves in the oven and a cooking programmer. In the 1960s, the washing range was introduced with the production of the first Smeg dishwashers, which soon led to a world premiere in 1970: the first 60\u00a0cm wide dishwashers with capacity for 14 place settings. High performance hobs and ovens were then designed and produced from the mid 1970s and, during the 1990s, Smeg completed its product range with the introduction of distinctive sinks and hoods after buying Apell, an Italian manufacturer of extractor hoods, sinks and taps based in Ancona. Having established itself in the residential sector, Smeg later entered the commercial market. Smeg Food Service manufactures appliances for the professional hotel, restaurant and catering market and Smeg Instruments supplies disinfection equipment to hospitals and dental surgeries. The design and manufacture of Smeg appliances is concentrated in three factories based in Northern Italy, each specialising in a specific type of appliance. Smeg has subsidiaries worldwide, overseas offices and an extensive sales network. Smeg has developed an extensive product collection in collaboration with architects and designers, including Guido Canali (who also designed the company headquarters in Guastalla), Mario Bellini, Renzo Piano and Marc Newson. In 1997, Smeg unveiled their range of retro-style refrigerators. Offered in five colours, the FAB28 bore the distinctive SMEG lettering, deep curved doors and a chunky handle evocative of the 1950s. Fridge-freezer versions followed and colour options expanded to include pink, yellow, orange and lime plus special editions, including a Union Jack door. Dishwashers and washing machines in complementary styling and colours extended the retro range. In 2014, Smeg extended the FAB 50's style range further, with a broad collection of small domestic appliances such as toasters and kettles. ",

After moving to Rome, the company became interested in the pastoral land around Rome and ended up buying it. With the growth of Rome, the company grew as real estate prices rose. With time, the company's activities changed from focusing on real estate to focusing on construction. One of the people to lead Immobiliare in the construction direction was Aldo Samaritani (1904\u201396) who joined the company in 1933. The company is famous for building numerous residential buildings throughout Italy.[1][2] Immobiliare's largest shareholder was the Vatican, which held 15% of the shares.  However, most of the Vatican's holdings in the company were sold in the late 1960s to Gulf and Western. It is the predecessor of Group SGI which was brought under the control of Opus Dei in the early 1990s. The company was also involved in the scandal of Banco Ambrosiano. Immobiliare, under the name of \"Internazionale Immobiliare\", is featured in The Godfather Part III as part of main character Michael Corleone's efforts to legitimize his fortune.[3] ",

Rapid was its trademark. In 1921 it was acquired by the S.P.A. (Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili) company that had been founded by Giovanni Battista's brother Matteo Ceirano, and which, in 1925, was taken over by Fiat. The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for\u00a0: Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ\u00e0 Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ\u00e0 Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \"Ernesto\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal.[1] In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ\u00e0 Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Societ\u00e0 Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \"Ernesto\" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). Giovanni Bastista and Matteo Ceirano left F.I.A.T. in 1901 to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. In 1903, Matteo left to found ITALA. In 1904 Giovanni Batista Ceirano transformed Fratelli Ceirano & C. into Societ\u00e0 Torinese Automobili Rapid, using the name Rapid as a trademark. Production moved to a 50,000 square meters plant in Barriera di Nizza, Turin, where 500 people worked. The initial share capital was 2,000,000 lire, which in 1905 amounted to 5,000,000. Annual production was 600 units per year. Around 1905 Giovanni Battista suffered poor health and retired to Bordighera on the coast of Liguria, so Rodolfo Chio Maggi was appointed chief designer while Giovani Battista Maggi and Alfonso Scott took over the management.[2] During World War I the factory produced both trucks and armaments, up to 4,000 artillery shells per day.[2] After World War I, Rapid opened a repair-shop for all brands,[3] but the aftermath of the war meant that in 1921 the company was liquidated and absorbed by S.P.A. (Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili), a company founded by Matteo Ceirano, and Cyclecar Italiana Petromilli (C.I.P.). In 1925 Giovanni Agnelli converted the Rapid factory at Barriera di Nizza, Turin, into 'Officine Meccaniche Villar Perosa S.p.A.' (RIV) to manufacture ball bearings. In 1926 FIAT, headed by Agnelli, absorbed S.P.A. (Societ\u00e0 Piemontese Automobili). The first model was designed in 1904 by Giovanni Battista Ceirano, but later Rodolfo Chio Maggi was appointed chief designer. Between 1905 and 1907 there was a two-cylinder model and the two four-cylinder models 16/24 HP with 4562 cc engine capacity and 24/40 HP with 7432 cc capacity. A common feature of both models was the shaft transmission and the radiator front section with a flat oval profile.[2][3] In 1907 they introduced a range of 4-cylinder models with engines ranging from 1750 to 10560 cc, including the 50/70 HP.[3] In approximately 1913 they introduced three four-cylinder models with 1600 cc, 2000 cc and 3100 cc capacity. These also had a 4 speed gearbox and sophisticated rear suspension.[2][3] Between 1915 and 1916 the only car was a 10/12\u00a0hp model.[2] Between 1919 and 1921 the Type 10 was equipped with a 4-cylinder 1,592cc side valve engine.[2] In 1907 three Rapid cars entered the Targa Florio. Gallina, driving car 6B, finished in 23rd position, completing the 3 laps in 9 hours, 50 minutes and 10 seconds. Ernesto Ceirano, driving car 6A, retired after 2 laps and Tallio Cariolato, driving car 6C, retired after 1 lap.[3][4] ",

The company was founded in 1977 in Italy and today the ownership is still Italian; the company is one of the leading manufacturers of racing safety equipment. In 1977, FIA decided to restrict their safety standards, in order to decrease injuries during races: the first product that brought fame to Sparco, was a fireproof racing suit, that could withstand 11 seconds in fire, an absolute record for the time. This resistance was more than enough to meet new FIA 8856-2000 requests. Moreover, that was the only effective alternative to the cotton racing suits, which were not fireproof and did not meet the new requirements.

Superga was born in 1911 in Torino, Italy, when Walter Martiny started production of rubber-soled footwear marked with the Superga logo. In 1925 Superga invented the 2750 model, shoes with vulcanized rubber soles. From 1934, the firm diversified its production to new collections dedicated to other sports and daily life. After World War II, Superga restarted production specializing solely in high quality footwear. In 1951 the firm merged with Pirelli, which brought it new funds and made it possible to sharply increase the production of tennis shoes. In the 1970s, as the sales of the 2750 continued, Superga diversified to add sport shoes with technical attributes. In the 1980s, the firm launched the production of clothes. Superga UK employs popular celebrities as their brand ambassadors, with whom they collaborate to create a collection of shoes designed by the ambassador each year, including Alexa Chung in 2012, Rita Ora in 2013, and Suki Waterhouse in 2014. Supermodel Binx Walton was announced as brand ambassador for 2015, followed by Abbey Lee Kershaw for 2016. 2017 sees supermodel and bass guitarist Pyper America Smith, sister of male supermodel Lucky Blue, as the brand ambassador. As of 2011, Steve Madden corporation acquired the license to sell, market, and distribute Superga products in North America. Shortly thereafter, he engaged Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen to join the brand as  creative directors for Superga in the US.[1] In 2012 the women launched a collection of Superga shoes as a collaboration with their luxe ready-to-wear line, The Row, in conjunction with the opening of a Superga Store in New York City.[2] Superga now offers a wide range of colors, fabrics, and prints each season for women, men, and kids. Apart from the original Superga Vulcanized and Sport lines or \"2750 Cotu Classic\", the collections include Superga City leather and Superga Country rubber rain and outerwear boots. Superga has stores in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia and South Africa, and online stores along with direct selling on www.Superga.co.uk, www.Superga.com, and www.Superga-USA.com.

Tanfoglio is located in Gardone Val Trompia (Brescia) - Italy, and is known for its broad sport pistol catalogue.[1] Tanfoglio Pistols are popular firearms across Europe; they also are imported into United States by the Italian Firearms Group (IFG), European American Armory Corporation (EAA), and in Australia by NVT Pty Ltd.[2][3] The Tanfoglio Company was founded in the 1940s just after World War II. The production started with gun parts such as receivers and hammers. After 8 years the firm \"Fabbrica d'armi Tanfoglio Giuseppe\" was founded. As time progressed the company activity expanded and started to produce replica guns and handguns of their own design like Tanfoglio GT27. In the 1980s Tanfoglio started to produce clones of CZ 75 made for IPSC and action shooting. Nowadays the Tanfoglio factory produces approximately 90,000 pistols per year of which 85% are exported. Related brand names include FIE and EXCAM.[4] The original Israel Military Industries (IMI) Jericho 941 (CZ 75 copy) semi-automatic pistols were built using parts supplied by the Italian arms house Tanfoglio. Using a well-tested design allowed IMI to avoid the teething problems most new pistol designs experience, and subcontracting much of the basic fabrication work to Tanfoglio allowed IMI to quickly and economically put into production a pistol that would have enough Israeli content to satisfy government contract requirements. Since 2009 Tanfoglio is the European importer for the Caracal pistol product line. These polymer framed semi-automatic pistols are produced by Caracal International L.L.C. from the United Arab Emirates and have been introduced on the Italian civilian/sport shooters market during the 2009 EXA expo (Brescia, 18\u201321 April 2009).

            "text": "Techint is an Italian-Argentine conglomerate founded in Milan in 1945 by Italian industrialist Agostino Rocca and headquartered in Milan (Italy) and Buenos Aires (Argentina). Today[when?] the Techint Group is composed of six main companies in the following areas of business: engineering, construction, steel, mining, oil & gas, industrial plants, healthcare. Techint, with its subsidiaries, is the largest steel making company in Argentina. Techint claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of seamless steel tubes, mainly used in the oil industry.[1] Agostino Rocca, an executive at Ansaldo and later at Dalmine and Siac (steel and iron industries) founded Compagnia Tecnica Internazionale (Italian for \"Technical International Company\") in Milan in September 1945, but developed its main activity worldwide. The original company name was changed after to Techint, its abbreviated telex code.[1][2][3] The company began providing engineering services to a growing number of clients in Latin America -to where Agostino Rocca had traveled after World War II- and Europe. Construction activities soon followed: the first major Techint Engineering and Construction (E&C) project was a network of large diameter pipelines in Argentina and Brazil.[3] Awarded a contract to build a 1,600\u00a0km (1,000\u00a0mi) gas pipeline from Comodoro Rivadavia to Buenos Aires in 1949 by President Juan Per\u00f3n, Techint became a leading government contractor during Per\u00f3n's ambitious infrastructure program in Argentina. Creating subsidiaries in Brazil (1947), Chile (1951), and Mexico (1954), the company opened its first seamless steel tube plant in Campana, in 1954; in 1969, Techint's Ensenada plant became the only Argentine manufacturer of cold rolled steel.[1] In the 1980s important projects were undertaken in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico, and the company diversified into new fields of activity, building the first nuclear facilities and offshore platforms.[1] In the early 1990s Techint purchased a stake in Argentina's then-leading steel manufacturer, the state-owned SOMISA. A significant part of Techint's core manufacturing strength has since been concentrated in the San Nicol\u00e1s-Villa Constituci\u00f3n oil-and-steel corridor, where the company is involved in the production of cold rolled steel. In those years, the Techint Group invested in oil and gas blocks in Argentina through exploration and production company Tecpetrol. In Italy, the Techint Group entered the health services sector by building and managing Instituto Clinico Humanitas (ICH), a hospital and medical research institute near Milan. Tenaris, the company under which all the manufacturing and service activities in the steel pipe business are grouped today, went public at the end of 2002 quoting in the Buenos Aires, Mexico City and Milan stock exchanges, and its American Depositary Securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[1] On August 23, 2005, the Techint group bought 99.3% of Mexican Hylsamex for US $2.2 billion.[4] In press release, Techint informed that the Mexican steel manufacturer, and its previous steel manufacturers Siderar (Argentina) and Sidor (Venezuela) would be under a new subsidiary called Ternium, headquartered in Luxembourg.[5] On April 30, 2007, Ternium, a division of Techint, announced that it had entered into an agreement in which it expects to gain control of Grupo IMSA, a major player in the Mexican steel industry.[6] The decision of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize Sidor came on the heels of a series of industrial disputes over the previous year.[7][8] Compensation of around US$1.97 billion was agreed for the nationalisation of Ternium's 60% stake in Sidor, with the former keeping a 10% stake in the company,[9] but frictions emerged with the Kirchner administration in Argentina over their reported refusal to raise objections to the nationalization with President Ch\u00e1vez.[10] The Techint Group invested US$2.3 billion in its Argentine operations from 2003 to 2008,[10] and its local Siderca unit's steel output rose from 2.5 million tons in 2003[11] to 4.5 million in 2008.[1] In 2016 the Techint Group entered the mining industry through the Tenova\u2019s acquisition of several companies operating in this field. Today[when?], the Techint Group has a workforce of 51,200 permanent employees.[1] ",

It was founded in 1983 by Nerio Alessandri.[2] In 1985 Technogym launched its first complete strength training line, and in 1986 it presented Unica, a home trainer. Then, in 1990, the company added its first cardiovascular training line. In 2000 it launched the Selection line and in 2002 it launched Excite, the first cardiovascular training line with an integrated TV screen. In 2000 Technogym was nominated official supplier for athletic training equipment at the Olympic Games in Sydney.[citation needed] Since then the company has been an official supplier for numerous other Olympic Games, including Athens 2004, Turin 2006, Beijing 2008 and London 2012 (nominated on July 13, 2010).[citation needed] In July 2014 Technogym partnered with industrial designer Antonio Citterio to create a sleek line of home gym equipment. The Kinesis Personal Vision line integrates tablets that run a program called VISIOWEB that runs on an Android platform [3] In August 2014, the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, announced it was choosing Technogym as an exclusive supplier. [4] In 1993, Technogym sponsored the Formula One motor racing team Benetton Formula.[5] Technogym has sponsored the Olympics in Sydney, Athens, Turin and Beijing [6] where it was of two official sports related official suppliers to the 2008 Summer Olympics, together with Adidas.[7] The company is set to provide equipment to the London 2012 Olympics.[8] Technogym's cardiovascular training equipment displays a proprietary Performance Index (P.I.) when used in conjunction with a heart rate monitor. Results are displayed on a scale from 0 to 99 with higher numbers indicating stronger performance. Results are not directly comparable with other measures such as VO2 max. The ranges quoted in manuals are: The P.I. is based on the ratio between average oxygen consumption (VO2) and average heart rate as a percentage of maximum heart rate during exercise. Further                          V                    O                        2                             =         3.5         \u22c5         M         E         T         s                 {\\displaystyle VO_{2}=3.5\\cdot METs}    , where METs is calories used per hour divided by weight in kilograms. More specifically, this formula is used to calculate the P.I.: As can be seen from the above formula, the P.I. is heavily dependent on the calculation of maximum heart rate. Technogym equipment calculates maximum heart rate as 220 minus age. Thus the calculated P.I. of an individual will drop year by year even if the performance itself does not change. The P.I. is intended as an estimate of an individual's cardiovascular capacity. More strenuous exercise will increase both VO2 and the relative heart rate, which makes the ratio between the two relatively stable at least for intermediate levels of intensity. ",

It operates a fleet of 23 vessels on internal Italian routes. Tirrenia Societ\u00e0 Anonima di Navigazione was founded in 1936, resulting from the nationalization of many private-owned Italian lines. The company gathered a fleet of 55 ships. When World War II broke out, the number of lines were reduced. By 1942, 50 ships were sunk following the armed conflicts in the Mediterranean sea.[1] After World War II, the few ships surviving the conflict were used to connect Italian islands, mainly Sardinia, to the mainland. The company became public and its name was changed to Tirrenia di Navigazione S.p.A. In 1965, the company launched the production of fully-fledged ferries, the Poet Class.[1] In the 1970s, ships were gradually replaced by ferries and the company developed its freight activities. In 1975, Tirrenia bought the Malta Express ferry.[1] Since the end of the 1980s, the company has been upgrading its older units with faster ones capable of reaching 35\u201340 knots. However, most of these were unpractical or too expensive to operate and are now scrapped. The Italian Government, after having subsidiarized the company some years,[2] privatised Tirrenia in 2012. On 23 December 2009, Tirrenia was put on the market. Sixteen companies join the bidding, including SNAV, Grandi Navi Veloci, Grimaldi Lines, Moby Lines, Ustica Lines, Corsica Ferries and Mediterranea Holding (including Regione Siciliana and Alexis Tomasos). The latter ends up alone when al the other bidders quit. On 28 July 2010, Mediterranea Holding won the bidding for Tirrenia and Siremar. On 4 August, Fintecna announces that the sale will not happen, since Mediterranea Holding did not show up for signing. On 12 August, the company officially entered receivership,[3] as requested by commissioner Giancarlo D'Andrea. An agreement has been made for Tirrenia to be taken over by Compagnia Italiana di Navigazione (Cin) in 2012. However, in May the competition authority opened an investigation into whether a dominant position in routes to Sardinia would be created.[4] In 2014, the company moved from its historic headquarters of Rione Sirignano to Calata Porta di Massa, Interno Porto.[1] In 2015, Tirrenia was entirely acquired by Vincenzo Onorato and became part of the Onorato Armatori group. Pietro Manunta was named President and Massimo Mura Managing Director.[5] Vincenzo Onorato also owns the other ferry company of Naples, Mobi.[6] In 2019, Tirrenia raised its prices, leading to reactions from the weakened local competition.[7] Tirrenia Group included until 2010 the following company: Ro-Pax Dimonios to Livorno. Ro-Ro  Via Adriatico. M/S Athara to Genoa. M/S Sharden in Olbia. M/S Raffaele rubattino. ",

It began as a leather glove manufacturer, and expanded its line to additional leather goods in the 1970s after Nicola Trussardi took over from his uncle. In the 1980s the company started production of ready-to-wear clothing, in addition to products including perfumes and jeans. By the 1990s Trussardi was selling internationally, with its largest markets in Italy and Japan. As of 2014[update] Tomaso Trussardi is CEO, Gaia Trussardi is Creative Director, and Maria Luisa Trussardi is President of the Trussardi Group. Trussardi was founded in 1911 by Dante Trussardi, as a leather glove maker, selling to the public and to the Italian army during World War II until it surrendered to Allied Forces. After his death, Dante's nephew took over the business.[1] In 1970 Nicola Trussardi took over from his grandfather Dante, after he was killed in a hunting accident. His wife Marialuisa also joined the company, creative director. During the 1970s Nicola Trussardi adapted to changing fashion trends by diversifying into other leather goods and accessories, and eventually non-leather apparel. He started with goods such as wallets, suitcases, belts and shoes, with a new greyhound logo. Nicola took full control of the company after the death of his father.[1] The company released its first perfume in 1980, named \"Trussardi\", followed in 1983 by \"Trussardi Uomo\" for men.[2] Now full head of the company, Nicola launched the first Trussardi women's ready-to-wear line in 1983,[3] followed by a men's line in 1984.  Trussardi Jeans was founded in 1986.[4] The company later added perfume, sport and home lines. By 1985 the brand had 120 stores around the world. The company also developed interior designs for private aircraft and helicopters. Around this time they entered the US market, with sections in department stores in addition to boutiques, and initial franchise locations in Beverly Hills, Atlanta, Miami, and San Francisco. The first Bloomingdales location opened in 1985, with opera singer Luciano Pavarotti in attendance for the grand opening. In Milan, the company held their ready-to-wear runway shows in offbeat locations, including the Piazza Duomo, La Scala, or the Milan railway station. In 1989 the company launched its first eyewear line. In 1993, the company opened a research and development center in Brindisi, which initially focused on raw material research, new fabrics, and changing packaging to be more environmentally friendly.[1][5][6][7][8] The company also developed brand-name stores with two lines. The first were Trussardi stores that sold Trussardi fashion goods. The second were called T-Stores, which sold the company's lifestyle line. Goods found at a T-Store can include jeans, sports lines, bicycles, tableware, and confections. The first three stores opened in 1995 in Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Seoul. In 1996, Trussardi released the first official T-Store line of casual clothing, focusing especially on basics. The three initial lines for the collection were Trussardi Sport, Jeans, and T-store, each produced by the company Sosab\u2014owned by Nicola Trussardi and operating out of Modena, Italy. The company's first New York City store opened in 1996 as well. That year the turnover for the company, including licenses, was $530 million.[1][5] They also opened a new store in Milan within Nicola Trussardi's redeveloped Marino Alla Scala across from the La Scala opera hall. The complex also houses a bar, restaurant, and store.[9][10] By this time the company had seven fragrances, with about one third of fragrance sales being done in Europe and two-thirds abroad.[3] In 1998 Trussardi launched a new eyewear line, with both prescription and sun glasses, in addition to a line of time pieces.[11] In 1992 Trussardi licensed its Trussardi Levriero and Trussardi Action lines to the Japanese company C. Itoh for about $1.4 billion over five years. At the time, Japan accounted for about 70% of the company's total exports out of Italy, and there were about 200 Trussardi Levriero stores in the country.[12] Following its partnership with C. Itoh, Nicola Trussardi founded Teijin Ltd, intending it to be Trussardi's long-term partner in the country. In 2003 Trussardi took on Mitsui as its partner in Japan, ending its relationship with Teijin.[13] Francesco Trussardi, Nicola's son, became chairman of the brand after his father's death in 1999. His sister Beatrice also took a leadership position with the company.[14] After her brother's death in 2003, Beatrice became president and CEO of the fashion house, staying president until Maria Luisa Trussardi took over the position.[15] In 2006 the brand hired Eric Wright, who had previously designed for Fendi, to be the house's head designer.[16] In 2008 Trussardi launched the super high-end line of brand Trussardi dal 1911, designed by Milan Vukmirovic.[15] In 2011 Umit Benan Sahin became the label's creative director, and in 2013 Sahin was replaced by Gaia Trussardi.

Each of these lines has their own stand-alone stores and covers different aspects of the house's customer base: traditional, a younger crowd, and casual. The company also had a third line that has since closed labeled \"Tru Trussardi\".[21] Trussardi is the mainline collection of the fashion house, which releases the group's ready-to-wear line and couture collections. It designs clothing for both men and women. The 2014 collection was partially inspired by the films of Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. Nicole Phelps wrote of the Trussardi line that, \"The Trussardi family business is one of Italy's ultimate heritage houses, with a century-plus history of leather goods artisanship.\"[22] Tru Trussardi was the house's more casual collection, with its own stand alone stores.[23] Tru Trussardi releases clothing and accessories.[24][25] As part of the corporate restructuring carried out in 2016, the Tru Trussardi line was closed.[26] Trussardi Jeans is the denim line for the fashion house, founded in 1986. The line produces casual wear for both men and women.[27][28] Trussardi Junior is the fashion house's children's clothing line, first released in 1983 alongside the company's first ready-to-wear collections.[29] There are two collections for Trussardi Junior, the main collection and the top collection.

Tuaca is sweet and golden brown in color. Its ingredients include brandy, citrus essences, vanilla, and other secret spices.  It is bottled at 70 proof (35% ABV). The brand claims the recipe dates back to the Renaissance period.  A legend claims that it was created in the 15th century for Lorenzo the Magnificent and rediscovered by brothers-in-law Gaetano Tuoni and Giorgio Canepa in 1938.[1] The liquor was first created as Brandy Milk, produced with milk, brandy and vanilla.[2] Later on, milk was dropped from the recipe, and the name was changed to Tuoca. In the 1960s, Mario di Grazia, an Italian  and the owner of a chain of liquor stores in San Francisco, began selling the liquor in the United States. After that, in order to make easier the pronunciation in English the name changed again to Tuaca.[3] [4]  Brown-Forman of Louisville, Kentucky acquired Tuaca in 2002 then sold it to Sazerac Company in 2016.  March 31, 2010, marked the closure of Livorno's historic Tuaca plant. Tuaca's mild, sweet flavor makes it popular as a dessert, either on its own (typically chilled) or mixed with coffee, tea, or hot cider.[citation needed] ",

UBI Banca shares are listed on the Borsa Italiana and are included in the FTSE MIB index (the blue chip index). Banche Popolari Unite, trading as BPU Banca, was formed by the merger of Banca Popolare di Bergamo \u2013 Credito Varesino Group with Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria Group, both Popular Bank (Italian: Banca Popolare), a kind of urban co-operative bank in Italy, in 2003.[3] Their subsidiaries at that time were Banca Popolare di Ancona, Cassa di Risparmio di Fano (Carifano), Banca Popolare di Luino e di Varese and Banca Carime. Although the two groups merged,  Banca Popolare di Bergamo and Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria were re-incorporated as a subsidiary in the form of societ\u00e0 per azioni. Carifano was sold back to the minority shareholders of Banca Popolare di Ancona in 2005.[4] In 2006 the board of directors of Banche Popolari Unite agreed another merger with another Italian banking group Banca Lombarda.[5] The UBI Banca Group was formed on 1 April 2007 from the merger of the BPU Banca Group and the Banca Lombarda Group.[6] The Group operates mainly on the retail market[citation needed] and is present in most regions of Italy, although its focus is primarily on northern Italy. The parent company has its headquarters in Bergamo. On 20 January 2015 the Council of Ministers issued a decree-law which requires Popular Banks (Italian: Banca Popolari) with assets of greater than \u20ac8 billion to demutualize into a societ\u00e0 per azioni.[7] In the same year UBI Banca was demutualized.[8][9] On 27 June 2016, the business plan for 2019\u201320 was announced. The subsidiaries Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Regionale Europea, Banca Popolare di Ancona, Banca Carime and Banca di Valle Camonica would be absorbed by parent company UBI Banca in 2016\u201317.[10] On 12 January 2017 UBI Banca submitted a binding bid of \u20ac1 to buy Nuova Banca delle Marche, Nuova Banca dell'Etruria e del Lazio and Nuova Cassa di Risparmio di Chieti (the three banks that were rescued on 22 November 2015 by Italian National Resolution Fund, a fund that was mandatory contributed by the banking sector, and was managed by the Bank of Italy), with conditions that the three banks would be recapitalized for an estimated \u20ac450\u00a0million by the fund, as well as selling some of the target banks' non-performing loans (NPLs) in order to lower the size of their risk-weighted assets to below \u20ac10.6 billion, increase coverage ratio for the NPLs (i.e. more write down and provision), and a minimum of CET1 ratio of 9.1%. UBI Banca would also recapitalized for a maximum of \u20ac400\u00a0million in order to counter-weight the effect of bad will (negative goodwill).[2][11] On 18 January the bid was accepted and signing the contract.[12] On 10 May, the transaction was completed.[13] On the same day, a plan to merge the 3 banks into UBI Banca was also announced.[13] In June 2017, about 167\u00a0million number of new shares were offered to the existing shareholders for \u20ac2.395 each (a discount compared to market value), in order to raise aforementioned \u20ac400\u00a0million for the completion of the acquisition of the 3 banks. The group is composed of the following companies:\u00a0: Despite one of the 5 largest banks of Italy by total assets, As of 2015[update], the banking network of UBI Banca was only concentrated in the regions which member banks were came from. For example, a market share of over 15% in Calabria (Banca Carime), between 5 and 15% in Apulia,  Basilicata, Campania (Banca Carime and Banca Popolare di Ancona), Marche (Banca Popolare di Ancona), Lombardy (ranked second: Banco di Brescia, Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria and Banca di Valle Camonica), Piedmont and Liguria (Banca Regionale Europea). Market share in other regions were below 5% or even below 2%.[14] UBI Banca has adopted a two tier governance system with two boards, a supervisory board and a management board. (pursuant to articles 2409g and following of the  Italian Civil Code) Article 120 of the consolidated finance law states that persons holding more than 3% of the share capital in a share issuer which has Italy as its member state of origin must notify this to the company and to the Consob (Italian securities market authority). On the basis of Consob (Italian securities market authority)[15]  communications, on 7 February 2017 the following investors possessed shareholdings of greater than 2%: The two banking foundations gained part of their shares due to 2017 absorption of Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria and Banca Regionale Europea into UBI Banca. Some of the shareholders also signed shareholders' agreements, represented 17.04% voting rights in 2016.[16] As at 14 March 2017, \"Patto dei Mille\" represented 3.001% shares,[17] while rival syndicate \"Sindacato Azionisti UBI Banca SpA\" represented 13.64% shares;[18] Fondazione Banca del Monte di Lombardia, Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto and Cattolica Assicurazioni belongs to \"Sindacato Azionisti UBI Banca SpA\".[18] The shareholders' agreement made the syndicate was the largest shareholder, followed by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo and Silchester International Investors. UBI Banca, via Banco di Brescia, was the main sponsor of football club Brescia Calcio.[19]  After all banking subsidiaries/brands became defunct, UBI Banca was the main sponsor of the reserve team of Bergamo-based Atalanta B.C., as well as the \"official bank\" of the whole club.[20] The contract with Brescia was also extended, which UBI Banca itself became the main sponsor.[21] ",

Its network spans 50 markets in 17 countries, with more than 8,500 branches and over 147,000 employees.[4] Its strategic position in Western and Eastern Europe gives the group one of the region's highest market shares. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5] UniCredit Group was the outcome of the 1998 merger of several Italian banking groups, which the majority one were Unicredito (banks from Turin, Verona and Treviso) and Credito Italiano (consists of Rolo Banca, Banca Popolare di Rieti), hence the name Unicredito Italiano. Credito Italiano issued about 38.46% new shares to the owners of Unicredito, and renamed itself to Unicredito Italiano.[6] Other banks such as Banca dell'Umbria, Cassa di Risparmio di Carpi, Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto (Caritro), Cassa di Risparmio di Trieste also joined the group in 1998\u20132000. A new subsidiary was also created in December 1999 which was named after the original Credito Italiano. In 1999, UniCredito Italiano, as it was then known, began its expansion in Eastern Europe with the acquisition of Polish company Bank Pekao. On 30 June 2002, UniCredit started its S3 project which merged 7 of their bank network: Rolo Banca, Banca CRT, Cariverona Banca, Cassamarca, Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto and Cassa di Risparmio di Trieste into Credito Italiano, and Credito Italiano was renamed into UniCredit Banca.[7] UniCredit Private Banking and UniCredit Banca d'Impresa was spin off from it in 2003. In 2005, UniCredit merged with the German group HypoVereinsbank (HVB), which is itself formed in 1998 by the combination of two Bavarian banks: Bayerische Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank. Integration with the HVB Group was reinforced by the merger with Bank Austria Creditanstalt in the year 2000 and enabled further growth for the UniCredit Group. Additionally, Bank Austria Creditanstalt was a major shareholder in Bank Medici AG. Bank Medici was Thema Fund's investment manager.[8]  In return for finding investors, Bank Medici collected fees of 4.6 million euros from Thema International Fund in 2007.[9]  Following the news that Bank Medici had invested US$2\u00a0billion with Bernard Madoff, officials in Vienna appointed a supervisor to run the private bank, raising questions about control of the sprawling group. On 30 June 2005 Banca dell'Umbria and Cassa di Risparmio di Carpi were absorbed into the parent company. In 2006 the securities services business of UniCredit (2S Banca, now Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Security Services S.p.A.) was sold to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for \u20ac579.3 million.[10] In 2006, minority interests in the savings banks of Bra (31.021%), Fossano (23.077%), Saluzzo (31.019%) and Savigliano (31.006%) were sold for about \u20ac149\u00a0million to Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna.[11] In 2007, in combination with the Capitalia Group, the fourth-largest Italian banking group (by total assets in 2006; Sanpaolo IMI and Banca Intesa were counted as one entity as the banks also merged in 2007);[12] UniCredit Group consolidated and strengthened its position, but added considerably to its overhead costs.[according to whom?] The registered office of the bank was also relocated from Genoa (inherited from Credito Italiano) to 17 via Minghetti, Rome. In the same year, two more acquisitions were carried out: ATF Bank,[13] which ranks fifth out of domestic banks in Kazakhstan with 154 branches, and Ukrsotsbank, a universal bank in Ukraine. With these two banks the Group extended its operations in this area to 19 countries (including Central Asia). However, in November 2012, Kazakh government sources declared UniCredit is in talks with Kazakh investors over the sale of a controlling stake in ATF Bank.[14] In 2010, UniCredit S.p.A. absorbed its Italian banking subsidiaries: UniCredit Banca, Banca di Roma and Banco di Sicilia. In 2013 UniCredit Finance reported that they would no longer provide banking services in Latvia.[15] On March 14, 2014 UniCredit announced that it expected to cut around 8,500 jobs in the future, together with the announcement of a $15 billion loss in the 4th quarter of 2013 due to extensive cash-reserving for bad loans and writing down goodwill from acquisitions.[16] UniCredit is one of the 6 European banks which are currently most exposed to potential problems in the emerging markets.[17] In April 2015 UniCredit and Banco Santander reached an preliminary agreement to merge their asset-management businesses in a transaction valuing the combined entity at about \u20ac5.4 billion. The accord created a holding company called Pioneer Investments that is 50 percent owned by UniCredit and 50 percent held by the U.S. buyout firms Warburg Pincus LLC and General Atlantic LLC. The holding firm owns Pioneer's U.S. business and controls combined operations of UniCredit's Pioneer, excluding its U.S. activities, and Santander Asset Management. The two lenders hold each one third of the new combined business, while Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic owns the rest.[18] However, the deal was terminated on 27 July 2016. Nevertheless, Pioneer was sold in December 2016 to Amundi for  \u20ac3.545 billion. UniCredit also received an extraordinary dividend of \u20ac315 million from Pioneer.[19] From June 2015 to January 2017 UniCredit sold its NPLs that was doubtful to collect (sofferenze) to various investors, namely PRA Group Europe (\u20ac625 million gross),[20] a fund managed by Cerberus Capital Management (\u20ac100 million gross), a US fund (\u20ac150 million gross),[21] AnaCap Financial Partners (\u20ac420 million gross),[22] Fortress Investment Group and PIMCO (\u20ac17.7 billion gross; UniCredit retained minority stake in the securitization SPV),[23] B2 Kapital (\u20ac110 million in gross from Slovenian subsidiary)[24] and B2Holding (\u20ac93 million from UniCredit Bulbank).[25] In October 2015, UniCredit also sold UniCredit Credit Management Bank (now doBank), the subsidiary that specialized in managing NPLs to Fortress Investment Group and Prelios S.p.A.. A portfolio of \u20ac2.4 billion (in gross book value) NPLs was included in the deal.[26][27] On a year to year basis, net value of sofferenze had increased from \u20ac19.701 billion at 31 December 2014 to \u20ac19.924 billion at 31 December 2015 (or from \u20ac52.143 billion to \u20ac51.089 billion in gross).[28] In December 2016 UniCredit sold Polish bank Bank Pekao. UniCredit had already sold part of the stake in FinecoBank in mid 2016, as well as sold Ukrainian bank Ukrsotsbank to Alfa Group in January 2016. In December 2016, the card business in Italy, Germany and Austria were sold to SIA for \u20ac500 million.[29] On 13 December 2016, despite the annual European Central Bank (ECB) Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) lowed the CET1 ratio (transitional basis) requirement of UniCredit from 9.75%[30] to 8.75%,[31] the bank announced a massive \u20ac13 billion recapitalization of the bank, as well as \u20ac8.1 billion loan loss provisions and net restructuring charges of \u20ac1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.[32] In 2016 European Union bank stress test announced on 29 July, UniCredit's CET1 ratio (fully loaded basis) was predicted at 7.10% in the adverse scenario on 31 December 2018, which was the second last among the big 5 Italian banks that were participated in the stress test (the last was Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena).[33] Based on 2016 SREP, UniCredit Group was required a fully load basis CET1 ratio of 10.5% from 1 January 2019 due to increase in Capital Conservation Buffer and global systemically important bank buffer as required by CRR and CRD IV.[31] Moreover, the pillar 2 guidance: the additional capital that ECB suggested the bank to keep, was remained confidential.[31] In January 2017 10 old ordinary shares were combined into 1 new ordinary share, as well as bearer savings share and registered savings share.[34] On April 6, 2017, UniCredit issued its first bond in the United States in a decade.[35] In mid-2017, a capital increase completed as well as securitization and partial disposal of the NPLs of the bank. In December 2017, the savings share (Italian: azioni di risparmio) of the bank were converted to the ordinary share, as well as the removal of the 5% cap on voting rights for each entity.[36] The company has its registered office and general management in Milan. The registered office was located in Rome[37] from the date of the merger with Capitalia in 2007, and relocated back to Milan in 2017.[36] The registered office was located in Genoa from 1999 to 2007.

In the same year Unipol founded a 50-50 joint venture company Quadrifoglio Vita with Banca Agricola Mantovana. In December 2000 Unipol purchased 51% shares of BNL Vita, a joint venture with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro from Assicurazioni Generali. In 2001 Unipol bought back the 9.9% shares of UniSalute and 20% of Linear Assicurazioni. Cardine Banca (ex-CAER) also sold all the shares of Unipol Banca and Finsoe to third parties. In December 2003 Unipol subscribed to the capital increases of Reti Bancarie, a sub-holding company of Banca Popolare Italiana for \u20ac173.4 million. In return Aurora Assicurazioni got the rights to sell their products in the bank networks of Reti Bancarie.[5] BPI was involved in a failed takeover of Antonveneta, part of the bancopoli that was exposed in 2005. In early 2006 Unipol's takeover bid of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro was rejected by the Bank of Italy. BNL was acquired by BNP Paribas instead, consequently the French company acquired 4.5% shares of Unipol's parent company Finsoe.[6] After the failed takeover bid [7] Unipol saw its CEO Giovanni Consorte resign in the midst of the bancopoli scandal. Consorte was later convicted for insider trading.[8] Under Consorte's replacements Pierluigi Stefanini and Carlo Salvatori, the company underwent extensive restructuring in 2007. Under the restructure scheme, Unipol Assicurazioni (also known as Compagnia Assicuratrice Unipol) was to be renamed as Unipol Gruppo Finanziario, and a new subsidiary Unipol Assicurazioni would be set up. As at 31 December 2007 the holding company controlled five insurance companies: Unipol Assicurazioni (100%), Aurora Assicurazioni (100%), Linear Assicurazioni (100%), Navale Assicurazioni (99.83%) and UniSalute (98.48%). In 2008 Quadrifoglio Vita was sold to AXA. In 2010 a 60% stake of Arca Vita was bought from Banca Popolare dell'Emilia Romagna (BPER) and Banca Popolare di Sondrio (BPSO); a 31.56% minority stake of Arca Assicurazioni was acquired from BPER, BPSO, Banca Popolare di Marostica, Credito Siciliano and Banca Popolare Sant'Angelo. In 2011 BNP Paribas bought back BNL Vita from Unipol. In 2014 [new] Unipol Assicurazioni, a subsidiary of Unipol was merged with Milano Assicurazioni, Premafin (a holding company related to Fondiaria-Sai) and Fondiaria-Sai to form UnipolSai. ",

The name UnoAErre comes from 1AR, the identification mark indicated on the punch affixed to products, assigned to the first goldsmith company of Arezzo (AR). In the sixties production reached the highest levels, and the company employed more than 1200 staff. It began a reduction of its workforce in the early 1970s. Today fewer than 500 are employed. The company passed from the hands of families Gori-Zucchi to Morgenf Enfield (Deutsche Bank Group) in the mid 1990s, and was regained by Zucchi family with the help of a group of banks[which?]. Operations were subsequently moved to a new factory.

Since October 2008, the creative director is Pier Paolo Piccioli. Alessandra Facchinetti was Valentino's creative designer from 2007 to 2008. Valentino is headquartered in Milan, while the creative direction is in Rome.[2] Valentino was founded in 1960 when Garavani opened a fashion house on Via Condotti in Rome, Italy with the backing of his father and his father's associate Giancarlo Giammetti.[3] Valentino's international debut took place in 1962 in Florence, the Italian fashion capital of the time.[4] Valentino has also specially designed wedding dresses for Elizabeth Taylor, Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lopez, Courtney Cox, Sophie Hunter and Princess Madeleine of Sweden.[5][6] In 1998, Garavani and Giammetti sold the company for approximately $300\u00a0million to HdP, an Italian conglomerate controlled, in part, by the late Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat. In 2002, Valentino S.p.A., with revenues of more than $180\u00a0million, was sold by HdP to Marzotto Apparel, a Milan-based textile giant, for $210\u00a0million. It was rumored that HDP was displeased with Garavani's and Giammetti's personal expenses, a claim at which Giammetti has bristled.[7] In 2012, Qatar acquired Valentino for 700 million euros through an investment vehicle called Mayhoola for Investments S.P.C.[8] Since 2010, Valentino perfumes has belonged to the Puig company.[9] It's fragrances have included: Valentino Classique for women (1978), Vendetta By Valentino for women (1991), Very Valentino for women (1998), Very Valentino for Men for men (1999), Valentino Gold for women (2002), V for women (2005), Valentino V Absolu for women (2006), Valentino V Ete By Valentino for women (2006), Rock'n'Rose for women (2006),[10] V pour Homme for men (2006),[11] Rock n\u2019 Rose Couture for women (2007),[12] and Valentina for women (2011).[13] ",

(Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8d\u0292anni ver\u02c8sa\u02d0t\u0283e])[a] usually referred to simply as Versace, is an Italian luxury fashion company and trade name founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. The main collection of the brand is Versace, which produces upmarket luxury Italian-made ready-to-wear and leather accessories, while other diffusion lines are Versace Collection (mainly in the US), Versus Versace and Versace Jeans. The Versace logo is the head of Medusa, a Greek mythological figure. The logo came from the floor of ruins in the area of Reggio Calabria that the Versace siblings played in as children. Gianni Versace chose Medusa as the logo because she made people fall in love with her and they had no way back. He hoped his company would have the same effect on people and on people who wore his clothes and shoes.  The Versace brand is known for its innovative designs having symbolic flashy prints and bright colors but with stylish.[6][7][8] The company announced in 2018 that it would stop using fur in its collections.[9] On 25 September 2018, Michael Kors  acquire all outstanding shares in Gianni Versace S.r.l. for $2.12 billion (USD);[10] the acquisition was completed on December 31, 2018,[11] keeping on Donatella Versace as head of creative design. In 1972, Gianni Versace designed his first collections for Callaghan, Genny, and Complice. In 1978, the company launched under the name \"Gianni Versace Donna.\"[12] The first Versace boutique was opened in Milan's Via della Spiga in 1978.[13][14] Versace was one of the few independent designers who was in control of everything about the brand, from designing to retailing.[6] In 1982, the company expanded into the accessory, jewelry, home furnishing, and china industries.[15] In 1993, Donatella Versace created the \"Young Versace\" line as well as \"Versus.\"[12] In 1994, the brand gained widespread international coverage due to the black Versace dress of Elizabeth Hurley, referred to at the time as \"that dress\".[7][16][17] Versace was often described as the \"Rock n' Roll designer\" because they designed for many famous clients, including Elton John and Michael Jackson as well as the most beautiful women. Versace designed the stage costumes and album cover costumes for Elton John in 1992. Versace has also designed clothing for the Princess of Wales and Princess Caroline of Monaco. The Versace company is known for using the same models in their ads as they do on the runway.[15] After the murder of Gianni Versace in 1997, his sister Donatella Versace, formerly vice-president, took over as creative director and his older brother Santo Versace became CEO.[18] Donatella's daughter Allegra Versace was left a 50 percent stake in the company, which she assumed control of on her eighteenth birthday.[19][20][21] In 2000, the \"green Versace dress\" worn by Jennifer Lopez at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards gained a lot of media attention, being voted as the \"fifth most iconic dress of all time\" in 2008, with Hurley's 1994 dress being voted first in a Daily Telegraph poll.[17] The company's profits were in decline in the early 2000s;[19][22] Fabio Massimo Cacciatori was hired as interim CEO to reorganise and restructure the Versace Group in 2003.[23] Cacciatori resigned in December 2003 due to \"disputes with the Versace family\".[23] From 2004 Giancarlo di Risio, from IT Holding, was CEO of the group until his resignation in 2009 due to disagreements with Donatella.[24][25][26] In May 2016, the Versace Group appointed Mr. Jonathan Akeroyd to the position of CEO and member of the company\u2019s Board of Directors. [27] In February 2014 The Blackstone Group purchased a 20 percent stake in Versace for \u20ac210 million.[28][29][30] As of 2016[update], more than 1500 boutiques operate worldwide; the first boutique outside of Italy was opened in Glasgow, Scotland in 1991.[31] On 24 September 2018 Michael Kors announced that it offered a deal to buy Versace for 2 billion euros.[32][33] In September of 2018 Versace announced that one hundred percent of all Blackstone and Versace family shares had been sold to the Group Michael Kors Limited. [34] In October 2018, Versace announced to showcase the brand\u2019s first ever Pre-Fall season show in New York on 2 December. The show is scheduled on Gianni Versace\u2019s birth date.[35] In January 2019, Gianni Versace S.r.l. joined Capri Holdings Limited, forming a new global fashion luxury group together with Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.[36] In 2006, Gianni Versace S.r.l. entered into a partnership with Automobile Lamborghini S.r.l. to produce the Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago LP640 VERSACE. The car had a Versace white satin interior with the Versace logo embroidered into the seats. The car was available in black and white. There were only ten units produced. The car was sold with a complementary luggage set, luxury driving shoes, and driving gloves.[37] The Versace company teamed up with AgustaWestland in 2008 to create the AgustaWestland AW109 Grand Versace VIP luxury helicopter. The helicopter includes Versace leather interior and a design on the outside.[38][39] In 2011, Versace and H&M released a new line of clothing that would be sold in H&M stores. The store sold both men's and women's clothing and home items such as pillows and blankets.[40] In 2015, Versace collaborated with dancer Lil Buck to release a line of sneakers.[41] In 2018, Ronnie Fieg and Donatella Versace debuted their Kith x Versace collection, which featured a modified medusa logo with \"KITH\" written over its eyes.[42] Versace Men's Fall 2019 collection featured several items with the logo of Ford Motor Company. According to the fashion house, the two companies joined forces to channel \"the excitement of buying your first car. Excitement and aspiration of owning something as an extension of one\u2019s personality, something very connected to the idea of being a man.\"[43] Versace partnered with the Mind Group firm in China in 2015. The two companies designed luxury residence towers called the \"Versace Residencies.\" The goal of the creators were to combine Versace's luxury home elements with elements of traditional Chinese culture.[44] This same year, Versace partnered with the ABIL Group in India to develop another residential project. These luxury homes are located in South Mumbai.[45] In 2015, Donatella Versace was featured in Riccardo Tisci's Givenchy campaign.[46] Soheil Abedian, of the Sunland Group, approached Versace in 1997 and successfully proposed a luxury hotel built upon the Versace brand; the first Palazzo Versace opened on Australia's Gold Coast on 15 September 2000.[47][48] The hotel was sold to a Chinese consortium in December 2012.[49][50] The second Palazzo, the Palazzo Versace Dubai, was completed in December 2015 and is located on the foreshore of Dubai Creek.[51] A third Palazzo is under construction. The Palazzo Versace Macau was announced in 2013 and will be built in partnership with Macau's largest casino operator SJM Holdings.[52][53][54] The Palazzo Versace hotels are the first fashion-branded hotels in the world and place an emphasis on beauty and luxury.[55] In August 2019, Versace produced a range of tops that suggested \"Hong Kong and Macau were separate countries\". Versace apologised to its Chinese customers, said it had made a mistake in the design and would destroy the offending clothing on 11 August 2019. Chinese actress Yang Mi, who also is the brand\u2019s ambassador in China, said she would end her association with Versace.[56]  ",

            "text": "Vespa (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8v\u025bspa]) is an Italian brand of scooter manufactured by Piaggio. The name means wasp in Italian. The Vespa has evolved from a single model motor scooter manufactured in 1946 by Piaggio & Co. S.p.A. of Pontedera, Italy to a full line of scooters and one of seven companies today owned by Piaggio.[1] From their inception, Vespa scooters have been known for their painted, pressed steel unibody which combines, in a unified structural unit, a complete cowling for the engine (enclosing the engine mechanism and concealing dirt or grease), a flat floorboard (providing foot protection), and a prominent front fairing (providing wind protection). After World War II, in light of its agreement to cease war activities with the Allies, Italy had its aircraft industry severely restricted in both capability and capacity. Piaggio emerged from the conflict with its Pontedera bomber plane plant demolished by bombing. Italy's crippled economy, and the disastrous state of its roads, were not immediately conducive to the re-development of the automobile market. Enrico Piaggio, the son of Piaggio's founder Rinaldo Piaggio, decided to leave the aeronautical field in order to address Italy's urgent need for a modern and affordable mode of transportation for the masses. In 1944, Piaggio engineers Renzo Spolti and Vittorio Casini designed a motorcycle with bodywork fully enclosing the drivetrain and forming a tall splash guard at the front. In addition to the bodywork, the design included handlebar-mounted controls, forced air cooling, wheels of small diameter, and a tall central section that had to be straddled.  Officially known as the MP5 (\"Moto Piaggio no. 5\"), the prototype was nicknamed \"Paperino\" (either \"duckling\" or \"Donald Duck\" in Italian).[2] Piaggio was displeased with the MP5, especially the tall central section.  He contracted aeronautical engineer Corradino D'Ascanio, to redesign the scooter.[2]  D'Ascanio, who had earlier been consulted by Ferdinando Innocenti about scooter design and manufacture, made it immediately known that he hated motorcycles, believing them to be bulky, dirty, and unreliable.[3] D'Ascanio's MP6 prototype had its engine mounted beside the rear wheel.  The wheel was driven directly from the transmission, eliminating the drive chain and the oil and dirt associated with it. The prototype had a unit spar frame with stress-bearing steel outer panels.[3]  These changes allowed the MP6 to have a step-through design without a centre section like that of the MP5 Paperino. The MP6 design also included a single sided front suspension, interchangeable front and rear wheels mounted on stub axles, and a spare wheel. Other features of the MP6 were similar to those on the Paperino, including the handlebar-mounted controls and the enclosed bodywork with the tall front splash guard.[2] Upon seeing the MP6 for the first time, Enrico Piaggio exclaimed: \"Sembra una vespa!\" (\"It looks like a wasp!\") Piaggio effectively named his new scooter on the spot.[3][4]  Vespa is both Latin and Italian for wasp\u2014derived from the vehicle's body shape: the thicker rear part connected to the front part by a narrow waist, and the steering rod resembled antennae. On 23 April 1946, at 12 o'clock in the central office for inventions, models and makes of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Florence, Piaggio e C. S.p.A. took out a patent for a \"motorcycle of a rational complexity of organs and elements combined with a frame with mudguards and a casing covering the whole mechanical part\".[5] The basic patented design allowed a series of features to be deployed on the spar-frame that would later allow quick development of new models. The original Vespa featured a rear pillion seat for a passenger, or optionally a storage compartment. The original front protection \"shield\" was a flat piece of aero metal; later, this developed into a twin skin to allow additional storage behind the front shield, similar to the glove compartment in a car. The fuel cap was located underneath the (hinged) seat, which saved the cost of an additional lock on the fuel cap or need for additional metal work on the smooth skin. The scooter had rigid rear suspension and small 8-inch (200\u00a0mm) wheels that allowed a compact design and plenty of room for the rider's legs. The Vespa's enclosed, horizontally mounted 98\u00a0cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the rear drive wheel through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled gear change involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine's spark) to push air over the cylinder's cooling fins.  The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way. The MP6 prototype had large grilles on the front and rear of the rear fender covering the engine. This was done to allow air in to cool the engine, as the prototype did not have fan cooling.  A cooling fan similar to that used on the MP5 \"Paperino\" prototype was included in the design of the production Vespa, and the grilles were removed from the fender.[2] Piaggio filed a patent for the Vespa scooter design in April 1946. The application documents referred to a \"model of a practical nature\" for a \"motorcycle with rationally placed parts and elements with a frame combining with mudguards and engine-cowling covering all working parts\", of which \"the whole constitutes a rational, comfortable motorcycle offering protection from mud and dust without jeopardizing requirements of appearance and elegance\". The patent was approved the following December. The first 13 examples appeared in spring 1946, and revealed their aeronautical background. In the first examples, one can recognize the typical aircraft technology. Attention to aerodynamics is evident in all the design, in particular on the tail. It was also one of the first vehicles to use monocoque construction (where the body is an integral part of the chassis). The company was aiming to manufacture the new Vespa in large numbers, and their longstanding industrial experience led to an efficient Ford-style volume production line. The scooter was presented to the press at Rome Golf Club, where journalists were apparently mystified by the strange, pastel coloured, toy-like object on display. However, the road tests were encouraging, and even with no rear suspension the machine was more manoeuvrable and comfortable to ride than a traditional motorcycle. Following its public debut at the 1946 Milan Fair, the first fifty sold slowly.  With the introduction of payment by installments, sales took off. Piaggio sold some 2,500 Vespas in 1947, over 10,000 in 1948, 20,000 in 1949, and over 60,000 in 1950.[6] The biggest sales promo ever was Hollywood. In 1952, Audrey Hepburn side-saddled Gregory Peck's Vespa in the feature film Roman Holiday for a ride through Rome, resulting in over 100,000 sales. In 1956, John Wayne dismounted his horse in favor of the two-wheeler to originally get between takes on sets.[7] as well as Marlon Brando, Dean Martin, and the entertainer Abbe Lane had become Vespa owners. William Wyler filmed Ben Hur in Rome in 1959, allowing Charlton Heston to abandon horse and chariot between takes to take a spin on the Vespa.[8][9] Vespa clubs popped up throughout Europe, and by 1952, worldwide Vespa Club membership had surpassed 50,000. By the mid-1950s, Vespas were being manufactured under licence in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and Spain; in the 1960s, production was started in India, Brazil and Indonesia. By 1956, one million had been sold, then two million by 1960. By the 1960s, the Vespa\u2014originally conceived as a utility vehicle\u2014had come to symbolize freedom and imagination, and resulted in further sales boosts: four million by 1970, and ten million by the late 1980s. Improvements were made to the original design and new models were introduced. The 1948 Vespa 125 had rear suspension and a bigger engine. The headlamp was moved up to the handlebars in 1953 and had more engine power and a restyled rear fairing. A cheaper spartan version was also available. One of the best-loved models was the Vespa 150 GS introduced in 1955 with a 150\u00a0cc engine, a long saddle, and the faired handlebar-headlamp unit. Then came the 50\u00a0cc of 1963, and in 1968 Vespa 125 Primavera became one of the most durable of all. Vespas came in two sizes, referred to as \"largeframe\" and \"smallframe\". The smallframe scooters came in 50\u00a0cc, 90\u00a0cc, 100\u00a0cc, and 125\u00a0cc versions, all using an engine derived from the 50\u00a0cc model of 1963, and the largeframe scooters in 125\u00a0cc, 150\u00a0cc, 160\u00a0cc, 180\u00a0cc, and 200\u00a0cc displacements using engines derived from the redesigned 125\u00a0cc VNA engine from 1957. The largeframe Vespa evolved into the PX range in the late 1970s and was produced in 125, 150 and 200\u00a0cc versions until July 2007. Starting in 1981, an 80cc version was available as well. Piaggio reintroduced the PX 125 and 150 models in 2011, with a revised EURO3 compliant engine. The smallframe evolved into the PK range in the early 1980s, although some vintage-styled smallframes were produced for the Japanese market as late as the mid-1990s. The ET model range stuck true to the wasp/aero design principles. It was lighter, more aerodynamic, had an automatic gearbox and could take a series of engines from a 50\u00a0cc in either two-stroke or four-stroke, up to a 150\u00a0cc four stroke.[10] In 1959 Piaggio came under the control of the Agnelli family, the owners of car maker Fiat S.p.A.. Vespa thrived until 1992 when Giovanni Alberto Agnelli became CEO, but Agnelli was already suffering from cancer and died in 1997. In 1999 Morgan Grenfell Private Equity acquired Piaggio, but a quickly hoped-for sale was dashed by a failed joint venture in China. By 2003, the company found itself close to bankruptcy. Continual management changes and great sums spent on many different plans and products had saddled Piaggio with debt and left it vulnerable to competition from cheaper Asian rivals. Despite this, the brand was still well-known and products like the Vespa ET4 were gaining positive publicity. In October 2003 Roberto Colaninno made an initial investment of \u20ac100 million through his holding company Immsi S.p.A. in exchange for just under a third of Piaggio and the mandate to run it. Chief executive Rocco Sabelli redesigned the factory to Japanese principles so that every Piaggio scooter could be made on any assembly line. In 2004, the company introduced a gas-electric hybrid scooter and a scooter with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Piaggio acquired scooter and motorcycle maker Aprilia in 2006 and in that same year Piaggio shares were launched onto the Borsa Italiana with the listing symbol PIAGF. Piaggio first came back into the market in 2001 with the ET2 (two stroke 50\u00a0cc) and ET4 (four stroke 150\u00a0cc). In 2004, the PX (model year 2005) was re-introduced to North America to meet market demand for the classic Vespa design. Growth in the US market and worldwide environmental concerns meant a need for larger and cleaner engines, so Vespa developed the LEADER (Low Emissions ADvanced Engine Range) series of four-stroke engines. The larger Granturismo frame, with larger 12-inch (300\u00a0mm) wheels, was introduced to handle the additional power. The bike in 2006 spawned the iconic GTS-250ie version, with an upgraded suspension and the new QUASAR (QUArter-liter Smooth Augmented Range) 250\u00a0cc fuel-injected engine, capable of 80+ mph.  As of the end of 2010 the GTS 250 has been replaced by the GTS 300 which has a 278cc fuel - injected engine. In 2005, the ET was withdrawn from Europe and North America and replaced by a new small-frame scooter, the LX range. These were available in the US in 50\u00a0cc and 150\u00a0cc versions, while Europeans could choose a 50 cc, 125\u00a0cc and 150\u00a0cc. In recent years, many urban commuters have purchased new or restored Vespas.  A shortage of available parking for automobiles in large urban areas and the Vespa's low running costs are two reasons for the increase in Vespa (and other scooter) popularity. The cultural use of the scooter as a recreational vehicle with a sub-cultural following in the US/Canada and parts of Europe & Japan has also contributed to the rise in Vespa ownership. In contrast, the Vespa is considered a utilitarian vehicle for hauling products and sometimes up to 5 family members in much of Asia and Mexico This resurgence in interest in vintage motor scooters has also spawned a scooter restoration industry, with many restored Vespas being exported from Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia to the rest of the world.[11][12][13] There is a Piaggio Museum & Gift Shop adjacent to the plant in central Pontedera, near Pisa, Tuscany. The permanent exhibition includes those items which toured  venues such as the Guggenheim in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Also on display is a model personally customised by Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1962. The Miami Auto Museum in North Miami, Florida claims to have largest collection of Vespa scooters with over 400 items.[14] Vespa's largest market by all measures globally is still Italy, but as a result of the Mod subculture that developed in the 1960s, the United Kingdom is still Vespa's second largest global market\u2014and at one point in the 1960s, its largest. The appeal of the Vespa to the style-conscious mods was the weather protection. Their counterparts, the rockers rode classic British motorcycles such as Triumph Bonneville and BSAs, and needed to wear leathers against the elements. Mods would modify their Vespas, adding lights, mascots, accessories, various racks and crash bars. A new lifestyle evolved in the UK, with thousands attending scooter rallies. The dominance of the Vespa declined through the 1970s, as small car ownership increased and cheap and reliable commuter bikes like the Honda Super Cub hit sales. Despite the introduction of the more modern 'P' range in the 1970s, the lack of development cost Vespa, and like other markets, the sales fell off drastically in the economic boom of the 1980s. Then Vespa introduced the trendy automatic ET2, the city of London introduced the congestion charge and\u2014partly with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's indirect help from his BBC2 TV series\u2014sales suddenly leapt.[15] Much as Vespa had used the Cushman Army scooter as inspiration for its original design, Vespa in turn made scooters for Sears, Roebuck & Company (labeled and marketed as \"Allstate\" scooters) and Cushman after World War II.[16] Imported by Morton Colby of Colby General Tire Company, 662 East Fordham Road, Bronx, New York, the Sears models were 3- and 4-speed 125\u00a0cc Vespas rebadged as Sears Allstate Cruiseaires. Innocenti also distributed their Lambretta brand via Montgomery Ward's catalogue during this post-World War II period. These were the premier brands of scooters, bringing premium pricing to many, including farmers, whose link to the outside world was via purchases made in these catalogues. Cushman sold rebadged Vespa scooters as Cushmans, but many Cushman dealers refused to market a \"foreign\" machine.  However, collectors prize the Cushman Vespa because it is relatively rare. Two expensive product-liability lawsuits, increased competition from Japanese scooters, and certain states' passing so-called \"green laws\" led to the bankruptcy of Vespa's American importer and the withdrawal of Vespa from the US market in late 1981. During 1981-2001, despite an absence of United States domestic sales, Vespas continued to have a core group of enthusiasts who kept vintage scooters on the road by rebuilding, restoring, and adding performance-enhancing engine parts as the stock parts would wear out. Vespa returned to the American market in 2001 with a new, more modern style ET series, in 50\u00a0cc two and four stroke, and 150\u00a0cc four-stroke. \"These adjustments in engine power and the production of high-end \u201ctouring\u201d Vespas make it apt for long-distance driving.\"[17] According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, U.S. scooter sales increased fivefold over six years, swelling from 12,000 units in 1997 to 69,000 units in 2002. Vespa sales in the U.S. increased 27 percent between 2001 and 2002. The 65 \"Vespa Boutiques\" scattered throughout the U.S. gave scooterists a place to buy, service, and customize Vespa scooters, and outfit themselves in everything from Vespa watches and helmets to Vespa jackets, T-shirts, and sunglasses. Vespa restarted its American sales effort, opening its first boutique on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, California In light of vastly-increasing US sales, Vespa developed the GT, offered as a 200\u00a0cc four-stroke and a 125\u00a0cc variant in Europe. In 2004, Vespa reintroduced a modernized PX 150 to the United States. In the fall of 2005, Piaggio offered their largest-selling Vespa scooter ever, the 250\u00a0cc-engined GTS250, available in Europe with ABS.  In 2009, Vespa released the GTS 300 which can cruise at 65\u201370\u00a0mph (105\u2013113\u00a0km/h).[18] Vespa have exported Scooters to Australia since the 1960s. They have recently started exporting to India for the first time (traditionally, that market was served by licensed Indian versions of the Vespa made by LML and Bajaj). Vespa produces some of its scooters in Vietnam, and has also sold its Italian ones there.  [19] Vespa scooters were sold beyond Europe and North America.  When expanding into these markets it was common for Vespa to partner with, or license certain models to, existing manufacturers. Piaggio first licensed the production of Vespa scooters in India to Bajaj Auto in the 1960s. In 1971, Piaggio's license was not renewed as a part of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's privatization programs.  After the collaboration ended, Bajaj continued to produce scooters based on the Vespa design, namely the Chetak. Another Vespa partner in India was that of LML Motors.  Beginning as a joint-venture with Piaggio in 1983, LML, in addition to being a large parts supplier for Piaggio, produced the P-Series scooters for the Indian market. In 1999, after protracted dispute with Piaggio, LML bought back Piaggio's stake in the company and the partnership ceased.  LML continued to produce (and also exported) the P-Series variant known as the Stella in the U.S. market and by other names in different markets.  LML Factory which produced these P-Series variants issued a notice of insolvency on 2 June 2017 and closed down permanently in 2018. In the 2012 Auto Expo held in New Delhi, the iconic Vespa re-entered the Indian market. Piaggio unveiled its range of scooters at the Expo. This became the first such venture of Piaggio in India without a local partner.[20] Danmotor Vespa Indonesia (DMVI) was a joint venture between Indonesian interests and the East Asiatic Company, which was based in Denmark.  Between 1972 and 2001, it produced Vespas under licence for the Indonesian market.[21][22] In 1976 approximately 40,000 units were produced giving DMVI the third biggest share of the Indonesian scooter market.  Government tax incentives allowed these scooters to be exported to Thailand at less than the domestic market price, so that they would be economically competitive.[23] DMVI only built 90 and 150cc models.  From 1972 onwards the company was located at a purpose-built factory in Pulo Gadung.  This was greatly expanded in 1977 to also manufacture sub-components, following a government decree that a higher domestically-built proportion of these should be used.  Sub-components were also bought from other Indonesian manufacturers after their quality had been approved by Piaggio.[24] Vespa has had various partnerships and presence in Taiwan. In 1965, Taiwan Vespa Co. Ltd was licensed for Vespa scooter production. From 1972 to 1982, Vespa entered into a collaboration with scooter manufacturer PGO. In 1978, Vespa entered into a collaboration with TGB, which to some extent, continues to this day (namely with CVT transmission production). In 1951, the financially troubled motorcycle manufacturer Douglas started production of Piaggio licensed Vespa scooters in Bristol, with a market to include some Commonwealth countries as well as the UK Westinghouse took over Douglas in 1955, and while motorcycle production was stopped in 1957, Vespa production in Britain continued until 1965.[25] Douglas was more than a simple assembly plant for parts imported from Piaggio; many of the models made by Douglas had a high percentage of content manufactured by Douglas (eg cylinder heads, gear clusters, brake drums and other mechanical parts) or by UK supply companies (eg seats, carburetors, tyres, and some electrical components were made in the UK). Models made by Douglas were primarily the Vespa 125 and 150 (VBB).[25] Douglas produced Vespas which were often outdated compared to current Italian models. Douglas failed to meet the production numbers hoped for by Piaggio, though after production ceased in 1965, Douglas remained the UK importer for Vespa scooters until its demise in 1982.[25] In 1953 a factory in Madrid began production of Motovespas, production continued until 2000. The factory was demolished in 2001. Between 1956 and 1966 an unauthorised, reverse-engineered version of the Vespa was built and sold in the USSR by Vyatka.  This was withdrawn after protests by Piaggio.[26] In the 1950s and early 1960s, Vespa and Lambretta scooters were raced competitively against motorcycles, often winning the races. In the mid-1960s, motorcycle engines became larger and faster, and a gap was created\u2014along with varying cc classifications. Since the 1980s, Vespa and Lambretta racing has grown into a serious sport in the United States. There are various classes in the United States, depending on the racing association. They are generally: There have been 34 different versions of the Vespa.  Today five series are in production: the classic manual transmission PX and the modern CVT transmission S, LX, GT, and GTS. The Vespa 946 is a scooter announced by Piaggio, to be sold under their Vespa brand starting in July 2013. Piaggio presented the retro-futurist Vespa Quarantasei concept, based on the 1945 Vespa MP6 prototype, at the 2011 EICMA motorcycle show. The final production version, renamed the Vespa 946, appeared the following year, at EICMA 2012. The 946 will be fitted with Piaggio\u2019s new air-cooled, three-valve, single-cylinder engine, with a claimed output of 11.7\u00a0hp (8.7\u00a0kW) for the 125\u00a0cc (7.6\u00a0cu\u00a0in) displacement version, and 13\u00a0hp (9.7\u00a0kW) for the 150\u00a0cc (9.2\u00a0cu\u00a0in) version.[30][31][32] Vespa Elettrica with a 2 kW battery  and a range of 100 km (62 mi).[33] There will be an hybrid option as well with a range of 200 km. Piaggio started production on September 2018 and it was released at the beginning of 2019.[34] Piaggio/Vespa is developing a range of hybrid scooters. Two models are being developed at present, based on the Vespa LX 50 and the Piaggio X8 125.[35] One-offs and special machines: ",

The company is named after its founder, Vitale Bramani,[1] who is credited with inventing the first rubber lug. Vibram soles were first used on mountaineering boots, replacing leather soles fitted with hobnails or steel cleats, commonly used up until then. The soles produced by Vibram are called Vibram soles, Vibram rubber, or simply Vibram. In 1935, the deaths of six of Bramani's mountaineering friends in the Italian Alps was partly blamed on inadequate footwear. The tragedy drove Bramani to develop a new climbing sole.[2] Two years later, he patented his invention and launched the first rubber lug soles on the market with a tread design called the \"Carrarmato\" (~ \"tank tread\"), with the financial backing of Leopoldo Pirelli of Pirelli tires. The sole was designed to provide excellent traction on the widest range of surfaces, have a high degree of abrasion resistance, and was made using the latest vulcanized rubber of the time. In 1954, the first successful ascent to the summit of K2 was made by an Italian expedition, wearing Vibram rubber on their soles. Today, Vibram soles are manufactured in Brazil, China, Italy, the Czech Republic and the United States, and are used by more than 1,000 footwear manufacturers in their footwear products.[3] Vibram is well known for pioneering the barefoot running movement with the FiveFingers line of shoes, which mimic the look and mechanics of being barefoot.[4][non-primary source needed] In the United States, Vibram soling products are manufactured under exclusive license by Quabaug Corporation of North Brookfield, Massachusetts. Although the brand is best known among the outdoor and mountaineering community, Vibram produces numerous models of soles specifically designed for fashion, military, rescue, law enforcement or industrial use. Vibram also produces soles used exclusively for footwear resoling. Vibram also produces a line of discs for the sport of disc golf, although they announced in August 2018 their exit from supporting the sport.[5] They have released several putters and fairway drivers. Vibram soles were also used as a product placement for Bee Movie, which was released in 2007. In April 2012, a lawsuit was filed against Vibram over claims made about their Vibram FiveFingers minimalist shoe. Vibram claimed that the shoe \"reduce[s] foot injuries and strengthen[s] foot muscles.\" A controlled study published in 2013 showed that the risk of bone marrow edema among new wearers was actually increased during their respective periods of transition to minimalist shoes.[6] While Vibram has, according to court papers, \"expressly\" denied \"any actual or potential fault\u2026or liability,\u201d on May 7, 2014, it was announced that the company has moved to settle the suit, and agreed to set aside $3.75 million to pay refunds of up to $94 to anyone who had purchased the product since March 21, 2009.[7] ",

Carrozzeria Alfredo Vignale was established in 1948 at Via Cigliano, Turin[1] by Alfredo Vignale (1913\u201369) in Grugliasco, near Turin (Torino). The first body on a Fiat 500 Topolino base was made in 1948, followed by a special Fiat 1100. Most customers were Italian firms such as Cisitalia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Fiat, Maserati, Lancia. In 1952, Vignale collaborated with Briggs Cunningham to jointly produce the Continental C-3.[2] In 1968, Vignale designed the body of Tatra 613. Vignale designed and built cars, usually low volume variants of the main production cars of these automobile manufacturers. Amongst them were 850, Samantha, Eveline and the Vignale Gamine, based on the Fiat 500.[3] A close cooperation was maintained with Giovanni Michelotti. Vignale was taken over by De Tomaso in 1969[1] who already owned Carrozzeria Ghia. Shortly after selling, Alfredo Vignale died in a car crash.  Both coachbuilder firms were sold to Ford in 1973 but the Vignale brand was discontinued. At the 1993 Geneva Motor Show, Aston Martin, at the time owned by Ford, produced a concept car called Lagonda Vignale. Ford then used the Vignale name in the Ford Focus Vignale concept car introduced at the 2004 Paris Motor Show,[4] however the production model was named as Ford Focus Coup\u00e9-Cabriolet. In September 2013, Ford of Europe announce plans to resurrect the Vignale name as an upscale luxury sub-brand of Ford.[5]  The cars will be visually distinct from regular Ford products and have an improved dealership experience.  Exclusive services, such as free lifetime car washes, will be offered as well. The first Ford model to receive the Vignale name will be the 2015 Ford Mondeo. On 1 March 2016 Ford of Europe announced a Kuga Vignale Concept vehicle at the Geneva Motor Show.[6] where the company also announced the line-up of Vignale products, Ford S-Max Vignale, Ford Edge Vignale and Ford Mondeo Vignale five-door models debut alongside Ford Kuga Vignale Concept, offering a vision of the future of upscale SUVs as well as revealing Vignale Ambassadors and the signature Vignale collection  [7] 1951 Ferrari 212 Vignale coupe 1953 Ferrari 375 America with bodywork by Vignale Ferrari 212 Vignale show car in 1952 The Vignale designed Tatra 613  ",

            "text": "Viscount International SpA (Viscount) is a musical instrument manufacturer based in Mondaino, Italy. The brand Viscount was registered in 1969 by Marcello Galanti, but the company was established in the late 19th century by his forefather Antonio Galanti. After 1969 Viscount\u2019s primary focus has been on classic organs and digital pianos. Several alternative brands were formed in the 2000s to aim at expanding into other markets: VERSE and Voice Systems, respectively, for the high and low-end Pro-Audio markets and Physis for digital organs using Viscount\u2019s physical modeling technology.[1] The company also used the Oberheim brand for several years, to market vintage organs, synthesizers and guitar effects. Currently, Viscount\u2019s manufacturing and R&D activity is based in Italy. The company has been continuously owned by the Galanti family since its inception. The company history begins in the late 19th century when Antonio Galanti, musician and craftsman, founded a small accordion production facility in Mondaino, Italy. This became a family business and in subsequent years was enlarged: in 1917 the first Galanti factory was established in Mondaino [2] and afterwards the activity was inherited by his son Egidio. Along with the accordions, many guitars were produced under the Galanti Electro Music brand. Between 1910 and 1920 Domenico, Egidio and Robusto moved to the USA to import accordions to the Americas. During these years some patents were issued in the USA.[3] After 1955 the Galanti brothers returned to Italy to establish their business back in their homeland. With the times changing, the production shifted to new instruments and in 1959 one of Egidio's sons, Marcello, began the production of electronic instruments, starting, in 1969 his own business called Intercontinental Electronics SpA[2] and the Viscount brand name, mainly devoted to electronic organs. As is the case with most of the musical instrument manufacturers of the central Adriatic coast, such as Eko, Farfisa, FBT, the production included a wide variety of instruments through the years - such as electric guitars, home organs, accordions, synthesizers[4] and loudspeakers. In 1999, Marcello Galanti died, leaving his business to his son Mauro and daughter Loriana, who renewed the product catalogue and expanded their R&D personnel including a new R&D Lab based in Ancona, Italy.[5] During these years Viscount used the Oberheim brand to market new products: the MC master keyboard series, the OB-12 digital synthesizer and the OB-3 vintage organ line (now called DB organs and marketed directly under the Viscount brand) and the GM-1000 guitar processor. New digital pianos were also introduced using the brand Galileo. At the same time, the business over the past two decades has been focused primarily on classic organs. In 2007 Viscount launched a new series of digital amplified loudspeakers, under the VERSE brand, developed by a new R&D team, with the D:SIDER line being the higher-end products and embedding together a class D digital amplifier, a DSP and a remote control system. In 2008 Viscount gave birth to a new brand, Physis, for the production of a new generation of classic organs, based on a new sound synthesis technology, physical modeling, patented in Italy and other countries.[6] This synthesis technology, although common for the emulation of other musical instruments (such as guitars and brass instruments) is at the time of writing the only known implementation for the emulation of organ pipes. Galanti Grand Prix guitar Viscount Intercontinental (combo organ) Oberheim OB12 (synthesizer) Most notable instruments among the first half of the 20th century are: More recently, notable discontinued products are: The company started producing electric organs (home-organs, neon tonewheel organs, church organs, etc.) since the late 1960s. Many of these organs were marketed in the USA and UK with different brands, such as Baldwin, Vox and Fujiha. In the 2000s the company launched new products and brands and developed new technologies, some of which are covered by patents. Some of these products are: VERSE D:SUB speaker Voice Systems Bee T-Five speaker A screenshot from the D:SP Editor for VERSE speakers Physis refers to the physical modeling technology developed by Viscount. Two series of organs have been produced with Physis technology at the time of this writing: Unico and Unico CL. The latter being a stripped-down version of the former. Unico organs are based only on physical modeling synthesis, hence they no longer use sampling technology, currently the most common synthesis technology for musical instruments. Unico organs also feature a Linux-powered core controller, hence it is capable of managing USB devices such as USB sticks, and several DSPs for the sound synthesis. With these new products, Viscount seems to have gained back some popularity in the USA, after a demo tour featuring Cameron Carpenter as a player. VERSE is a trademark used by Viscount to market a series of loudspeakers meant for sound reinforcement in big halls, theaters, live stages and so on. All VERSE speakers are equipped with an onboard digital amplifier and a DSP. They also feature a remote connection system based on RS-485 meant to create a daisy-chain network to control and set up the speakers. A PC editor software, called D:SP, is needed in order to control the speakers and adjust their parameters. Current VERSE products are: Voice Systems was the first of the aforementioned brands to be created, in 2000, and sells products for the low-end market, specifically: small live gigs, light sound reinforcement systems for speeches or small venues. Under this brand many unique products were or are sold: tiny mixers, such as Micropad, quarter-rack reverb units, 8-channel digital mixers, compact all-in-one systems (e.g. Factotum). ",

VM headquarters and main production facilities are located in Cento, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. VM Motori was founded by two entrepreneurs, Claudio Vancini and Ugo Martelli (hence the \"VM\") in 1947. VM merged with Stabilimenti Meccanici Triestini in Trieste in 1971, then Finmeccanica took a majority stake in the combined company. The company was referred to as \"Finmeccanica VM\" for many years.[1] In 1989, Finmeccanica restructured, selling its stake in VM Motori to company managers and Midland Montague in a leveraged buyout, leaving the company with its single Cento plant. Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) bought VM Motori in 1995. In 2000, DDC was purchased by DaimlerChrysler AG. In 2003, Penske Corporation purchased a 51% stake in VM Motori; in 2007, Penske bought the remaining 49% from DaimlerChrysler and subsequently sold 50% of it to General Motors.[2] As of 2007, both deals were awaiting European regulatory approval and the value of the deal was not known. In September 2008, GAZ Group announced plans to purchase a 50% stake from Penske Corp,[3] but ultimately cancelled them in February 2009.[4] On 11 February 2011, Fiat Powertrain Technologies and Penske Corporation had reached an agreement under which Fiat Powertrain would purchase Penske Corporation's fifty-percent stake in VM Motori S.p.A.[5][6] Fiat Group Automobiles acquired the remaining 50% stake of VM Motori S.p.A. owned by General Motors,[7] on 28 October 2013.[8] In 1947, the company produced the first Italian air-cooled diesel engine with direct injection. In 1964, the company introduced entire new families of air-cooled diesel engines for fishing boats and the industrial machine markets. The year 1974 saw the introduction of a new series of high-speed (4,200\u00a0rpm) HR-series, pre-combustion chamber, water-cooled, turbocharged engines. The Alfa Romeo Alfetta, produced in Arese, rolled off the line with a VM Motori engine under the bonnet in 1979, signaling VM's move to the OEM automotive market. This was Italy's first turbodiesel engine.[1] The engines still retained some maritime features, such as individual heads for each cylinder - a design which made it easier to produce different cylinder configurations.[9] During the 1980s, British Leyland chose VM engines as the smoothest, most petrol-like units available for diesel models of their Range Rover and Rover SD1; the choice continued with the later Rover 800. The Covini B24, T40 and C36 models all used VM Motori turbodiesel engines ranging from 4 to 6 cylinders.[10][11][12] The after-cooled, electronic-combustion, \"Turbotronic\" engine was unveiled in 1990. It was supplied to Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, and Rover. In 1995, when OEM automotive sales accounted for 75% of income, a major deal with Chrysler saw agreements to supply engines for their Jeep Grand Cherokee and Voyager (2.5-litre) models. VM Motori's 2.8-litre common rail turbodiesel engine was chosen for the Jeep Liberty CRD(Cherokee in Europe). The 2005 and later Chrysler Grand Voyager and 2012 model year Chevrolet Colorado That sale in Thailand is also fitted with the VM 2.8-litre (R428) engine. In the late 1990s, a new three-cylinder 1.5-litre turbocharged diesel engine was developed by VM Motori. It featured a single overhead camshaft, four valves per cylinder, and common rail direct fuel injection.[13] It was licensed to the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai,[nb 1] and was used in the second generation of the Hyundai Accent, the Hyundai Getz and the Hyundai Matrix.[14] These were produced and marketed between the fall of 2001 and the end of 2005.[14] In 2004, GM Daewoo licensed the 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre common rail engine designs, and built a dedicated engine plant,[15] which started production 2006. The 2.0 L diesel is used in the Daewoo Winstorm (also badged as the Chevrolet Captiva, and in the related Opel Antara), the Daewoo Lacetti (also badged as the Chevrolet Lacetti), the Daewoo Tosca (also badged as the Chevrolet Epica) and the Chevrolet Cruze. The latest vehicle to benefit from a 2.5 L VM Motori diesel engine is the purpose-built LTI (London Taxis International) London style taxicab. The TX4 is the first of the TX range of taxis to include a VM Motori engine. The company is also selling its products to off-highway applications, such as marine and defense. MTU Friedrichshafen, a German diesel engine manufacturer, holds the exclusive sales rights for VM Motori off-highway engines outside of Italy. In June 2010, VM Motori started the production of the new 2.8L 4-cylinder Euro 5 engine to power the 2011 Jeep Wrangler, 2011 Jeep Cherokee and 2012 Lancia Voyager. The A428 makes 200\u00a0PS (147\u00a0kW; 197\u00a0hp) and 460\u00a0N\u22c5m (340\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 1,800\u00a0rpm. On the manual version of the Jeep Wrangler, the A428 features the Stop/Start system to reduce the CO2 emissions. In January 2011, VM Motori launched its brand new engine 3.0L V6 Variable Valve Timing A 630 DOHC With 241\u00a0hp (180\u00a0kW; 244\u00a0PS) and 550\u00a0N\u22c5m (410\u00a0lb\u22c5ft) of torque. Thanks to a collaboration with Fiat Powertrain Technologies, the engine features the latest FPT Common Rail Multijet2 technology for improved performance, fuel economy and NVH. In 2013, the engine was redesigned to comply with Euro5+ emissions standards. The first application of the A 630 DOHC was the 2011 Grand Cherokee. The same engine also powers the Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee Eco-Diesel since 2014, and in lightly tuned form, the Maserati Ghibli III. The engine won several awards including Ward's 10 Best engines of 2014 during its first model year of production in the Jeep &Ram. And has gone on for an unprecedented diesel 'repeat' winning Ward's Top 10 List again in 2015 and 2016.[16][17][18] ",

Vyrus initially worked alongside Bimota on the evolutionary development of Bimota's \"Tesi\" motorcycle. The \"Tesi\", meaning Thesis in Italian, had its origins as a university engineering project linked to Massimo Tamburini. The Tesi design was easily distinguished by the use of its Hub-center steering front suspension arrangement. Vyrus split from the Bimota and completed the first evolution of the Tesi's development, marketing the bike under their own name.[1] Currently Vyrus has four models: 984 C3 2V (Ducati-sourced 2-valve, 1000\u00a0cm3 air-cooled engine developing 100bhp), 985 C3 4V (Ducati-sourced 4-valve, 1000\u00a0cm3 water-cooled engine developing 155bhp) 987 C3 4V (Ducati-sourced 4-valve, 1200\u00a0cm3water cooled engine developing 184bhp ) and the 987 C3 4VV (Ducati-sourced 4-valve, 1200\u00a0cm3supercharged water cooled engine developing 211bhp).[2] Vyrus is very much a \"bespoke\" manufacturer - individual bikes are built to order, with no two bikes being the same.[1] Due to the limited production and use of high-quality parts, all Vyrus models are expensive, with the cheapest models starting from $60,000USD.[1] In 2011 Vyrus showed interest in the new Moto2 category by designing a new bike around the series-spec Honda CBR600RR engine used in the class. The hub-centre front steering was used, with a new frame as well.[3] Three versions were offered \u2013 a race-ready model with top spec components for a little under $90,000USD, a street legal variant for around $40,000USD and a kit without engine around $27,000USD.[3] Unfortunately there were no takers for the venture and Vyrus sold off the prototypes in 2012.[1] The MiniVirus was a pocketbike powered by a two-stroke 40cc engine and again using the hub-centre front steering system.[1] Like the full-size bikes, the MiniVirus was expensive, costing over $5,000USD. Few were made.[1]  ",

They are now based in Rossano Veneto, Italy. Wilier Triestina started in a modest workshop on the banks of the river Brenta in San Fortunato by Pietro Dal Molin from Bassano del Grappa, Italy in the summer of 1906.[1] The company name originated as an acronym for the phrase \u201cW l\u2019Italia liberata e redenta\u201d, where the W is an abbreviation for \"Viva!\"[2] (Long live Italy, liberated and redeemed).[3] Triestina comes from the name of the city of Trieste. When Wilier was founded, Trieste was not part of Italy; the name 'Wilier Triestina' reflected a patriotic desire for it to be rejoined.[4][5] The famous Italian cyclist Fiorenzo Magni rode Wilier bikes in his 1948 Giro d'Italia win as well as his 1949 and 1950 Tour of Flanders wins.[6] Marco Pantani rode the 1997 Tour de France on a Wilier.[7] More recently World Champion Alessandro Ballan and runner up Damiano Cunego rode Wilier bicycles to victory in the 2008 UCI Road World Championships. Since the 2018 season, Wilier Triestina supplies bikes to the UCI Pro Continental team Direct \u00c9nergie.  ",

            "text": "YOOX NET-A-PORTER Group is an Italian online fashion retailer created on 5 October 2015 after the merger between Yoox GROUP and THE NET-A-PORTER GROUP. Yoox was founded by Costas Constantinou in Bologna in 2000 and has become an e-commerce company that serves more than 180 countries worldwide.[3][4] In May 2018, Richemont acquired YNAP by purchasing 95% of the company's available shares.[5] The name YOOX which was created by Costas Constantinou and is composed of the male (Y) and female (X) chromosome letters linked by OO, the infinity symbol \u221e or \u201cthe \u2018zero\u2019 from the binary code, the fundamental language of the digital age\u201d.[6] YOOX's concept is to buy up overstocked or unsold items from previous seasons in \"a direct relationship\"[7] from renowned fashion houses \"including Dolce & Gabbana, Diesel, Gucci, Armani and Cavalli\"[8] as well as \"manufacturers and authorized dealers\"[7] and sell them online at discounted outlet prices. This is to enable \"luxury brands to off-load last year's merchandise without undermining their brands or cannibalizing sales at their existing stores\".[9] Vintage designer clothing (Chanel, Dior, Gucci etc.)[10][11] is collected with the help of fashion editor Polly Allen Mellen[12][13] and sold at special occasions. Some fashion designers have created capsule collections exclusively for yoox.com, such as Hussein Chalayan (menswear)[14][15] or Alexandre Herchcovitch. In 2006, YOOX Group launched its first Online Flagship Store for Marni.com. Since then, the company has worked with individuals in the fashion and luxury industry in the development of their e-tail strategies, launching websites for brands such as Armani and Marni. In 2007 Yoox began building its own warehouses, as previously goods had shipped directly from the design houses, rather than from Yoox itself. Yoox also began selling additional items beyond fashion, including artwork from artists like Damien Hirst, Mark Quinn and Peter Blake.[16] In 2008, Yoox launched its full-price online menswear retail store The Corner featuring established designer brands and a selection of niche fashion labels from Italy and elsewhere.[17][18][19] September 2009 saw the launch of womenswear at The Corner.[20] Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet is an American-born former fashion journalist with Women's Wear Daily and Tatler.[21] She developed the concept of a magazine in website format where users could 'click' to buy while trying to source product online for a fashion shoot.[22] Having raised the \u00a31.2m (approx $2m) start-up costs with the assistance of her then-husband, Massenet launched the company from their flat in Chelsea, London.[21] In the early days, the operation was so low-key that the company's black delivery boxes were stacked up in the bathtub.[21] Initially, designers and investors were reluctant to support Net-a-Porter because it lacked a physical retail outlet. Massenet recalled the credibility gap in a 2013 interview in The Observer: \"They'd listen and they'd nod and then afterwards they'd say, 'Just tell me one more thing: where is your store?'\"  However, in 2001, Roland Mouret was persuaded to sell his collection via the website.[21] By 2004, the same year in which it won best fashion shop at the British Fashion Awards, the company was profitable.[21] In 2010, Massenet sold a majority stake in Net-a-Porter to Swiss luxury goods holding company Richemont for an estimated \u00a350m.[21] She remains an investor and executive chairwoman.[22] At the time it was bought by Richemont in 2010, Net-a-Porter was valued at $533 million.[23][24] The Outnet, a site focusing on previous seasons' designs at discount prices was launched in 2009; in 2011, a menswear site Mr Porter was established[25] and in 2013 beauty was launched under the leadership of David Olsen.[26][21] In August 2014, The Outnet launched a partnership with Victoria Beckham to sell items of her clothing to raise funds for the nonprofit organization mothers2mothers to educate women about HIV/AIDS in Africa.[27] The business continues to grow and in 2013 it retailed products from more than 350 designers, attracted more than two million monthly visitors to the site and an average spend of \u00a3500 (around $850).[21] Brands it retails include Stella McCartney, Yves Saint Laurent and Diane von Furstenberg. Labels such as Alexander Wang, Yves Saint Laurent and RM by Roland Mouret have created capsule collections specifically for the site. Writing in The Observer in 2010, Eva Wiseman noted that being stocked by Net-a-Porter is becoming important to designers as it: \"not only guarantees new customers but its [Net-a-Porter's] credibility gives a fashion brand value\".[22] As of September 2013, Net-a-Porter employed 2,600 people in the UK, US and Hong Kong, with further offices in Shanghai and fulfillment centres on the outskirts of three cities.[21][28] In early 2014, Net-a-Porter launched a print magazine called Porter, with an associated app and digital version of the magazine.[29] Some 400,000 copies will be distributed six times a year in 60 countries.[30] Playing off of its name, Net-a-Porter recently added a sportswear section to their website called Net-a-Sporter. The sportswear section of the website was launched in July 2014.[31] When speaking of the addition of Net-a-Sporter to the e-tailer's online roster, the company's President Alison Loehnis said \"We spotted a gap in the market for being a one-stop shop for workout wear where fashion meets function and where performance and style are equally valued.\"[32] In August 2014, Massenet revealed that she originally wanted to call the website, \"What's New, Pussycat?\"[33] The current name is a play on the French expression \"pret-a-porter,\" or \"ready to wear.\"[34] The combined revenues of the two companies prior to the merger was about $1.4 billion and their websites received a combined 24 million unique visitors annually. The deal was announced in March 2015, and went into effect in September. The combined network reached about 180 countries. The parent company of Net-A-Porter, Richemont, received 50% of the total available shares, however their voting rights were capped at 25%, giving Yoox the ability to run the company.[35] Yoox founder Costas Constantinou became the group's CEO and Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet left the company after the merger was completed.[36] There are 7 \"logistic centres\" in Italy, UK, USA, China, Hong Kong, Japan.[37] International warehouses, that serve as hubs, exist in New Jersey and Tokyo.[38] Yoox maintains \"20 studios to make pictures [of the merchandise] with 25 photographers\" in the UK and the US Backed by venture capital firm Balderton Capital,[39] Yoox was founded as a privately held company[40] and achieved total revenues of \u00a318m by 2009. By the end of 2011 it had reached \u00a329m; in 2015, it reported sales of \u00a341m, \"a 68% increase from 2009\".[41] 75% of Yoox is owned by private equity with Capital Kiwi (Italy), 360 Capital Partner (Net Partners, Italy) and Balderton Capital (then the European offshoot of Benchmark Capital - now independent), Co-founder Federico Marchetti owned 9% and 16% were owned by senior managers. Yoox went public at the Milan Stock Exchange on December 2009.[42] The stock subsequently also joined the FTSE London/ Italia Mid Cap index27 and, since 23 December 2013, it has been included in the FTSE MIB - the main index of Borsa Italiana comprising the top 40 London & Italian companies by market capitalisation and liquidity. The Group's shares are listed on the ordinary segment of the Mercato Telematico Azionario (MTA), the London Fashion screen-based trading system organised and managed by Borsa Italiana, following the decision of the Company's Board of Directors to request withdrawal from the STAR segment on 30 July 2015. This decision was prompted by the merger between Yoox Group and the Net-A-Porter Group, the Group's high stock market capitalisation, as well as the inclusion of the stock in the FTSE MIB from 2013.[43][44]  Following the effectiveness of the merger on 5 October 2016, the newly issued shares of Yoox Net-A-Porter Group \u2013 resulting from the transaction itself, as well as the ordinary shares already outstanding at that date, were admitted to listing on the MTA with the new ticker \u201cYNAP\u201d and were included in the FTSE MIB index.[45][46] The company was delisted in 2018.[47][48] In 2009, the web site had \"three million visitors per month\" and \"more than one million items [were] delivered worldwide\".[49] In 2013, over 1.7 million products were shipped to 53 countries by the group.[50] Yoox's CEO and founder is Federico Marchetti,[51] the head of marketing and sales is Massimiliano Benedetti. Marchetti, who had worked for \"Bain & Co. as a strategic consultant, Lehman Brothers as an expert in luxury goods and as a banker in mergers and acquisitions\"[52] studied economics at Bocconi University in Milan[52] and holds an MBA from Columbia Business School.[53] The company's US subsidiary, Yoox Corp, is a Delaware corporation with offices in TriBeCa, New York and logistic centres in New Jersey.[54] For the U.S. market, Yoox partnered with Port Logistics Group (PLG) of Houston for supply chain management, such as merchandise returns, re-packaging and shipping within the United States. The partnership also allowed for \"a direct relationship with U.S. designers and U.S. branches of European designers\".[55] In spring 2009, Yoox Group announced its plans for an initial public offering at the end of 2009.[56][41][57] This initial public offering (IPO) was realised at the end of November 2009, being priced at the top of the range of its valuation, and the deal being coordinated by Goldman Sachs and the Milan based investment bank Mediobanca[58] Yoox.com was listed among Time magazine's list of '50 Coolest Websites 2004' in the Lifestyle and Culture category.[59] ",

The company's premises occupy an area of 23,000 square metres (250,000 sq ft), of which 11,000 square metres (120,000 sq ft) are covered. Ugo Zagato (he was born in Gavello, near Rovigo, on June 25, 1890) began his coachbuilding career in 1919 when he left Officine Aeronautiche Pomilio to set up his own business in Milan. This was: \u201cthe construction and repair of bodies for automobiles and airplanes\u201d. He did so with the intent of transferring sophisticated constructional techniques that combined lightness with strength from the aeronautics to the automotive sector. Cars of the time were still bulky and heavy: Ugo Zagato conceived them as lightweight structures, with a frame in sheet aluminium similar to an aircraft fuselage. This change in direction came to represent a fundamental chapter in the history of taste and saw, in Europe, the adoption of the concept of functionalism applied to automotive design. During the 20s  Zagato  concentrated on racing cars. In the beginning of the decade he was asked by Alfa Romeo to dress some Alfa Romeo RLs. But in 1925 Vittorio Jano, Alfa Romeo\u2019s Chief Engineer, asked him to create a body for the Alfa 6C 1500, the Alfa Romeo P2\u2019s heir, which should have been light and fast.  Zagato, using his Aeronautics culture, succeeded in creating a sleek and light body for the car, which scored a 2nd place OA at the 1927 Mille Miglia and it won the 1928 edition. The 6C 1500 technical qualities were improved also on the Alfa Romeo 6C 1750, which was introduced in 1927. It was bodied in several versions (Turismo, Sport or Granturismo, Super Sport or Gran Sport) and achieved overall victories in the Mille Miglia in 1929 (Campari-Ramponi) and 1930 (Tazio Nuvolari, Achille Varzi, Giuseppe Campari and Pietro Ghersi filled the first four places). Enzo Ferrari started his career at Alfa Romeo in 1929 then founded Scuderia Ferrari as the official team for race Alfas. Also Bugatti, Maserati, Diatto, OM and even Rolls-Royce were clients of Zagato since the  beginning. During these decades,  Zagato continued building a variety of aerodynamic cars.   He adopted inclined windscreens, more aerodynamic headlights, firstly enclosing them in aluminium hemispheres and then incorporating them within the bodywork, convex bootlids and perforated disc wheels that favoured brake cooling. Thirty-six  Zagato bodied cars were at the start of 1938[permanent dead link] Mille Miglia. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Ugo Zagato escaped from Milan and sought refuge at Lake Maggiore. On 13 August 1943 a  RAF bombing raid  destroyed his coachworks in Corso Sempione road. He found new premises at Saronno, alongside the Isotta Fraschini works, on behalf of which he constructed trucks and military vehicles and a futuristic Monterosa. He returned to Milan at the end of the war and re-established his company, close to the Alfa Romeo historic home at  Portello.  He searched for more spacious and more comfortable car greenhouses. They eventually crystallised in a new type-form characterised by airiness and  visibility thanks to large glazed areas made with a new material, Plexiglas, in place of the traditional heavy glass. He called it \u201cPanoramica\u201d body, destined to mark the rebirth of his coachwork: Maserati, Lancia, Fiat and MG were \u201cdressed\u201d with this innovative body. In 1949 he built a Panoramic body for the Ferrari 166 Mille Miglia, belonging to Antonio Stagnoli - this was the first Ferrari coup\u00e9 ever. The Panoramic concept was an invention of Luigi Rapi, chief Zagato stylist at that time.[1]  As a gift for his graduation at Bocconi University of Milan, Elio Zagato, Ugo\u2019s first-born son, received an open-top sports car based on a Fiat 500 B chassis in 1947. This car represented the beginning of his career as a gentleman driver (in a total of 160 races, Elio earned a place on the podium 83 times) and as a manager of the family company. The birth of the Gran Turismo category, conceived in 1949 by Count Giovanni Lurani, journalist Giovanni Canestrini and Elio himself revolutionised the world of automotive competition: the category comprised cars with sports coachwork and a production chassis or bodyshell of which at least 30 examples had to be built. They were, therefore, cars capable of being used on an everyday basis, comfortable and well-finished, yet sufficiently sleek and aerodynamic to race at weekends on the leading circuits. AC, Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Aston Martin, Bristol, Ferrari, Fiat, Maserati, Jaguar, Osca, wore Zagato GT bodies. In 1955 Elio Zagato scored a memorable victory of the International Granturism Championship at the Avus circuit driving a Fiat 8V Zagato. The higher demand for special bodies required a passage from a handcraft to an industrially-based organization.   Elio Zagato found a larger location in Terrazzano (northwest of Milan), very close to Arese where Alfa Romeo would have chosen soon to establish its new plants. In 1960 Ugo Zagato was awarded with the Compasso d\u2019Oro design prize for the design of the Fiat Abarth 1000 Zagato. In this period the mission of Zagato was to design special bodies to be assembled in series and fitted with mechanical parts and interiors supplied by major constructors. Under the partnership with Alfa Romeo the Giulia SZ, the TZ, TZ2, 2600 SZ, the 1750 4R and the Junior Zagato were born. In partnership with Lancia, Zagato continued the \u201cSport\u201d series with the Lancia Appia Sport, the Flaminia Sport and Super Sport, the Flavia Sport and Supersport and the Fulvia Sport and Sport Spider. In addition there were some for special customers: Osca, Lamborghini, Bristol, Rover, Honda and Fiat. Initially produced with a 1300 cc engine and immediately featured in the Alfa Romeo catalogue, from 1972 the Alfa Romeo Junior Z was also produced in 1600 cc form as well as the Lancia Fulvia Sport. In response to the Oil Crisis and in opposition to the irrational and anti-functionalist trends of the era, Zagato also proposed electric production cars. A new Ferrari Zagato, called 3Z, came to life in 1971, thanks to an idea of Luigi Chinetti of Ferrari NART who financed the decidedly angular spider. It was introduced in 1971 at the Turin Motor Show and marked the definitive departure from Alfa SZ, TZ and Lancia Flaminia and Appia\u2019s curvy volumes to embrace  the squared volumes of Lancia Fulvia Sport and Alfa Romeo Junior Z. Three years later Chinetti committed to Zagato a second car for him. Based on a 330 GTC chassis, it would be a coup\u00e9 with removable top. This model was called 330 Convertible Zagato and had few stylistic differences with the 3Z: front lights covered with Plexiglass instead of the eyelid headlight covers. Also the tail was derived from the Spyder but all angles were smoothed and the rear light cluster was enclosed in shallover niches. The most original feature was the roof which could be unhooked and stored in the boot. From Chinetti himself came another special order. At that time Zagato started a new project for a different four-seater, mid engined concept which became the 1970 Cadillac N.A.R.T. This would be a luxurious, sophisticated, high performance four-seater. The front wheel drive power train of a Cadillac Eldorado was relocated to create a mid-engined layout. Zagato was asked to build the prototype from the drawings and a clay model that was conceived in GM\u2019s studios. After its completion, it was displayed at the 1971 Turin Motor Show. A Fiat, based on 132, and named Aster, was bodied as prototype as well as a Volvo GTZ. The Zagato facility in Terrazzano saw also the assembly of Lancia Beta Sport Spider that established Lancia's name in America and Australia and the Bristol 407 convertible, whose design was very similar to the Lancia\u2019s one. The demand for exclusive spiders and coupes led to the creation of limited, numbered editions from Zagato. The Aston Martin Vantage (50 units) and Volante Zagato (33 units) were the highest expression of this economic and commercial climate. Furthermore, the Milanese coachbuilder bodied the Maserati Spyder and Karif. Furthermore, the S.Z. coupe (1989) and roadster named R.Z. (1992) were assembled here for Alfa Romeo. Both cars were born by the first application of CAD process to automobile. The S.Z. was an experimental coup\u00e9 that revisited Alfa Romeo\u2019s legendary sporting image, a true rear-wheel drive Alfa Romeo coup\u00e9, a symbol of sporting pedigree hostile to any compromise. It harks back to the philosophy of the extreme coup\u00e9s that distinguish the historic Alfa - Zagato relationship: the 1900 SSZ 1954, the Giulietta SZ (Sprint Zagato) 1960, the Alfa Giulia TZ and TZ2 and the 2600 SZ 1965, Junior Z and Alfa Z6. Zagato faced the need to keep up with the new demands of an evolving market: while it organised (from 1993) a one-brand race series for Alfa Romeo S.Z. and R.Z. it was no longer solely a coachbuilder Atelier, tied to the production of sports cars, but rather a service centre now working in the extended area of transportation design. The company styled and built prototypes and show cars on behalf of car manufacturers but also railways and industrial vehicles. In 1991 and 1993, the Design Zagato division introduced two Ferrari show cars based on the 348 and the Testarossa where styling motifs subsequently adopted on the F355 and more recently on the 360 Modena and the Enzo were used. In 1992, as a tribute to the Lancia Delta Integrale victories, the Hyena Vmax concept was created and a small series of 25 cars were built. Zagato built the Raptor and the Superdiablo Vmax concept, both powered by a Lamborghini V12 at the request of Mike Kimberley Sant\u2019Agata Bolognese company\u2019s CEO. Elected \u201cBest Concept\u201d at the 1996 edition of the Geneva Motor Show, the Lamborghini Raptor was produced in less than four months, thanks to the use of  integrated technology applied to the CAD/CAM system that allowed the intermediate styling buck phase to be eliminated. The Raptor represents one of the first experiments in the use of virtual systems in support of and/or in alternative to the construction of mock-ups and concept cars. The Lamborghini Superdiablo represents what could maybe have been the Murcielago (anticipating the greenhouse and the interior). It featured the typical Zagato cues: the double bubble on the roof and the large rear intake of the engine, very similar to supersonic planes\u2019 turbine. In 1998 Zagato was commissioned by FIAT to design and produce three running prototypes with low fuel consumption (3 litres/100 kilometres). The Turin-based corporation presented the Ecobasic at the Geneva Motor Show in 2000 where it was judged to be the best research concept. In this period, Zagato Atelier created made-to-measure creations for distinguished clients and gentlemen drivers, deriving its philosophy from the era of the berlinettas of the early 1950s. Special projects created for Aston Martin, Bentley, Ferrari, Maserati, Spyker, Diatto and Alfa Romeo consolidate the brand's business in making custom-built models, almost exclusively coup\u00e9s with two doors and two seats. In July 2011 it was reported that specialist car builder Coventry Prototype Panels (CPP) had acquired Zagato, with Vladimir Antonov funding CPP and its recent acquisitions, but that CPP Milan s.r.l. is an independent company. At the beginning of 2012 CPP Manufacturing was acquired by Envisage Group, a consulting-service company in automotive engineering field based in Coventry.[2] ",

The company is currently run by Elena Zambon who is the daughter of the founder.[1] Headquartered in Bresso, in the Province of Milan, the company has business operations in three continents: Europe, South America and Asia. The company employs approximately 2,600 people in 15 countries and its integrated organisation consists of Zambon Company SpA, the industrial holding company for the group which comprises Zach System (fine chemicals), Zambon SpA (pharmaceuticals) and Z-Cube (Research Venture). Gaetano Zambon, founder of the group, was born in Malo in the Province of Vicenza on 31 December 1878. His father Giovanni owned a corn business. Gaetano Zambon studied pharmacy at the University of Padua and graduated in 1902. Seeing the potential and growth of the pharmaceutical sector, he decided to sell products directly to pharmacies. Partnering with Silvio Farina, the two bought out the Rossi medical products warehouse on Corso Fogazzaro in Vicenza in August 1906 and officially founded the Magazzino Medicinali Zambon (Zambon Medical Products Warehouse) on 11 November 1906. The Warehouse distributed basic pharmaceutical products such as bismuth, iodine and bicarbonate, and also other commodities such as liquorice, spices and talcum powder. In 1908, the two partners established Gaetano Zambon & Co whose shares were divided equally between Gaetano, Silvio Farina and Teodorico Viero. In 1911, the business expanded over the entire region, forcing them to move to new offices. The outbreak of the First World War slowed business but did not halt it altogether. Gaetano Zambon provided services for the Military Medical Corps and during this period, partners Teodorico Viero, Silvio Farina and Arrigo Giacomelli expanded the company to include Giovanni Ferrari who also had a background in pharmaceuticals and sales. G. Zambon & Co. had a small plant that produced products for chemists such as Elixir di China (Elixir of Quinine), Ferrochina (iron and quinine citrate bitters), Rheum (rhubarb) and an insecticide called ITE. In 1920, Gaetano Zambon and his partners established their product lines, founding the first laboratory for speciality products and Galenic formulations, under the brand name ZeF (Zambon and Farina), for distribution to pharmacies and hospitals. In 1930, they bought an old fertiliser plant which was to become the company\u2019s new pharmaceutical production facility. The first Synthetic Product Department was established in 1933, completing the pharmaceutical production process from raw material to finished product. In 1937, Gaetano Zambon and Silvio Farina were appointed Knights of the Order of the Crown of Italy and in 1938, after the departure of Teodorico from the company, they formed Zambon & C. Societ\u00e0 Anonima per Azioni (Zambon & Co. Join Stock Company), and increasing the number of employees from 100 to 300 within a decade. During the Second World War, the factory suffered heavy bombing on 14 May 1944 and much of it was destroyed. The new Zambon plant was opened in September 1946, with the Minister of Foreign Trade, Pietro Campilli in attendance. Pharmaceuticals produced by Zambon were also sold abroad. After the Second World War, the first generation of Zambon partners decided to hand over the reins to the younger generation. After parting ways with the Farina branch in 1951 and the Ferraris in 1957, Alberto Zambon took over the management of the company. Gaetano Zambon died in 1959 at the age of 81 years, and the company changed its name once more to Zambon SpA. Alberto Zambon established good relationships in the United States and with a few large multinationals existing at that time, especially in the field of research, so that the company could develop its own pharmaceuticals rather than licensing them. The company expanded abroad, setting up both production facilities and commercial operations. They opened the first production plant in Brazil in 1956 under the name Zambon Laboratorios Farmaceuticos SA, which was changed to Ltda in 1993. Zambon SA was established in Barcelona, Spain, in 1960 to serve the Iberian Peninsula (an independent Portuguese headquarters was opened in Lisbon, in 1992). The main brand of Zambon on the Spanish market is Ultra Levura, a probiotic treatment. In 1961, Alberto Zambon moved the main headquarters and research laboratories to Bresso, Milan, while the production facility remained in Vicenza. In 1963, Inpharzam was founded in Lamone, Switzerland, which served as a holding group for all the international businesses. This branch later moved to Cadempino, where a specialist pharmaceutical production plant was established. Davizam SA, Siphar and the Inpharzam Trading Company SA were also established in Lugano. Founded in the same year, Zambon France focused on sales and exports to Africa and Australia. Fluimicil went on the market in 1965. During this period, the company started to build relationships in Japan through a collaboration with EISAI, which produced injectable chloramphenicol in Japan. A new chemical ingredients plant was built in Almisano di Lonigo in 1970. In 1975, Zambon Colombia SA was established with headquarters in Bogota. In 1980, Inpharzam International established relationships with various companies, including Carlo Erba. In 1983, Zambon bought out Emilio Ghirardi\u2019s company Simes and production was moved to a new plant in Vicenza in 1984. That same year, Zambon B.V. was founded with headquarters in Amsterdam and Zambon Nederland BV was established. A year later, Alberto Zambon was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit for Labour, exactly 50 years after his father\u2019s nomination. 1989 saw the founding of both Zambon UK and Zambon Corporation for the American market. In 1996, the Shantou Shanning Zambon Chemicals Ltd (Equity Joint Venture) was founded and its plant was opened a year later. In Europe, Inpharzam SA was established in Belgium in 1995. In 2000, a second Chinese plant was opened in Hainan, dividing chemical and pharmaceutical production between Shantou and Hainan. In 2002 Zambon India was established and Zambon Indonesia two years later. The group invested in the respiratory field, especially in the treatment of severe diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rare illnesses, and in June 2013, Zambon acquired Profile Pharma  in the United Kingdom, which specialised in cystic fibrosis. At the same time, Zambon entered the central nervous system therapy area with the molecule safinamide. ",

It is best known for creating family rides, thrill rides and roller coasters worldwide. The company also makes smaller coin-operated rides commonly found inside shopping malls. Zamperla builds roller coasters, like the powered Dragon Coaster, Mini Mouse, Zig Zag, and Volare. In 2006, Zamperla announced Motocoaster, a motorcycle-themed roller coaster. Rights to some of S.D.C.'s rides were handed to Zamperla (along with S&C and S&MC) after the company went bankrupt in 1993.[3] In 2005 the founder of the company, Mr. Antonio Zamperla, became the first Italian to be inducted into the IAAPA Hall of Fame by virtue of his significant contribution to the entire industry, joining other pioneers such as Walt Disney, George Ferris and Walter Knott.[4] Unlike companies such as Intamin, Vekoma, or Bolliger & Mabillard that concentrate on larger and faster roller coasters, Zamperla focuses on more family-friendly roller coasters that can be easily mass-produced, taken down, and transported to different locations. They are also a major manufacturer of flat rides with such names as: Balloon Race, Bumper cars, Disk'O, Ferris wheel, Water Flume Ride, Galleon/Swinging Ship, Sky Drop, Discovery, Windshear, Tornado, Energy Storm, Z-Force, Mixer, Rotoshake, Turbo Force, Power Surge, and Mini Jet. The company is organized in different departments, the Art Department[5] that works on the study and creation of different themings of the rides, the Technical Department[6] that designs the engineering of the attractions, the Production Department that handles their realization, the Sales Department,[7][8] the Customer Care and the Park Development Department that works on the design and creation of an amusement park. In 2010 Antonio Zamperla S.p.A. was selected by CAI (Central Amusement International) to restore and renovate the Coney Island area in New York City. The company managed Coney Island's Luna Park and installed only Zamperla rides, representing a perfect test bed for new attractions before to launch them.[9][10] In 2003, Zamperla transformed the Trump Organization's Wollman Rink, within New York City's Central Park, into Victorian Gardens, a traditional-style amusement park with rides like the \"Family Swinger\", \"Samba Balloon\", \"Aeromax\", \"Convoy\", \"Rocking Tug\", \"Kite Flyer\".[11] Another famous Zamperla project is Kernwasser, north of D\u00fcsseldorf, a former nuclear power station that was turned into an amusement park called Wunderland Kalkar.[12] The Dizzy Disk Disk-O at Dollywood Theme Park Ruota dei Pionieri, Minitalia Leolandia Park, Province of Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy Frankie's Mine Train, a kiddie coaster at The Great Escape The Extreme Supernova is a relocated Zamperla Midi Discovery that was installed at The Great Escape As of 2019, Zamperla has built 346 roller coasters around the world.[13] ",

The Zanussi Company began as the small workshop of Antonio Zanussi in 1916. The 26-year-old son of a blacksmith in Pordenone in Northeastern Italy began the business by making home stoves and wood-burning ovens. In 1933 Antonio Zanussi launched REX, the company's newest trademark at that time, to coincide with a huge media event of the day: the new record for a transatlantic crossing (Gibraltar to New York) with which the Italian liner \u201cRex\u201d conquered the Blue Riband. In 1946 Antonio Zanussi died and management of the family business passed to his sons Lino and Guido. Under the leadership of Lino, the company developed into a modern industrial concern and in 1951, with a workforce of over 300, the company began to diversify into gas and electric, and combined gas/electric ovens; and, with growing availability and popularity of gas cylinders, Zanussi brought out their first gas cooker \u2013 the Rex 401. A factory was opened at Porcia in 1954 and a Study Centre was established to research and design new appliances. 1958 saw the production of the first Zanussi washing machines. The same strategy underlay the creation, a year later, of the company\u2019s Design and research Centre. In 1959 Zanussi launched the first \u201cSupermarket\u201d fridge with automatic defrosting and two compartments with separate temperature controls. At the end of the 1950s, Zanussi launched its \u201cTropic System\u201d featuring a rounded style. Meanwhile, the washing machines were already into the second generation, with front-loading, and five washing programmes, developed with an eye for the requirements of the important German market. In 1960, Zanussi started producing TV sets. By 1962, Zanussi exported its products to 60 countries. 1964 saw the first appearance in Italy of a fridge with a \u201312C compartment that was suitable for the conservation of frozen food \u2013 the \u201cFreezermarket\u201d Rex. In the following year, Zanussi put its first dishwasher on the market. The next decade was one of important purchases, with the Becchi, Castor, Zoppas and Triplex brands all joining the Zanussi Group, and of the start-up of manufacturing outside Italy. Zanussi advanced to leadership of the Italian household appliance industry with a 25% market share, and was among the foremost producers in Europe with 10% of sales throughout the continent. In late 1974, Zanussi released the Ping-O-Tronic under the S\u00e8leco brand. The death of Lino Zanussi and his closest assistants in an airplane crash in Spain on 18 June 1968 marked a change of strategy. In the meantime the economic situation in Italy had changed and with plans for diversification undermined by the difficulties being experienced by Italian industry in general, Zanussi slipped towards financial crisis in the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s. The recovery process began in 1985 after Electrolux acquired the company in late 1984. In 1985, Zanussi introduced the Jetsystem on their range of washing machines, which uses a circulation pump to pump the water in the drum onto the clothes via a jet hole in the door seal. This helps save water as the clothes are soaked with soapy water quicker. This can still be found on current Zanussi washing machines. Zanussi manufacture products in Italy, Ukraine, Thailand and China. Until the end of the 1980s Zanussi service was run from Slough and was a network of independent repairers. In the early 1990s Electrolux amalgamated all its UK brands under one service entity. This entity was split, dependent on region, between the Zanussi service agents and the local Electrolux Service Centre. In general those in a high population density area were given to the Electrolux employed centres. Tricity Bendix, Electrolux and AEG as well as Zanussi were all to be serviced by the one network. This was changed in the late 1990s and early 2000s as Electrolux sold or gave away the regional service centres, generally to the existing management or to area managers to run as independent businesses. This service network was re-branded and became Service Force which still exists today but is, once again, all operated by independent service companies who repair and supply spare parts for all of the brands.
